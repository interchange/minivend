MiniVend 2.03 - User reconfiguration and internet-domain server,

* Re-configuring a catalog can now be done on an individual
  basis.  No more server re-starts for a user to change their
  configuration.

* MiniVend no longer requires DBM, though it is still best to use
  GDBM or DB_File if available. There is a file-based session
  storage message mechanism, and product databases can
  be stored in memory.  This is automatically selected if
  appropriate.

* Multi-server mechanism changed completely.  Only one
  server runs when in quiescent state -- it forks additional
  servers as necessary, up to a limit you decide.  This works
  around a memory leak in Safe.pm, the server can now run for
  months on end.

* Runs on just about any Unix operating system with
  no changes, providing Perl 5.002 is available.  This
  includes IRIX, which formerly would not run MiniVend.

* Perl subroutines can now be defined on three levels, and
  directly called from MiniVend pages. Two use the Safe.pm module
  for enforcing security, while an administrator-enabled GlobalSub
  routine can run external programs for complete control.

* mSQL support is now considered stable, and the databases
  can be updated by forms from within MiniVend.

* The link CGI program may now use TCP-based sockets, which
  allows the link CGI to be located on a different machine than
  the MiniVend server.  Be careful of security, though!

* Perl link programs are provided for systems without a C compiler.
  (Solaris still needs a C compiler for File::Lock, unless it is
  already installed on Perl.) Not production quality -- user
  help would be appreciated.

* Search sorting can be done right on the page from returned
  fields, and be sorted by field based on form options.

* The [if ...] conditionals are much improved.  Contained
  HTML can now be deferred until the last interpolation pass
  with the [post] [/post] tag pair.

* New mv_click and mv_check special variables set multiple
  form parameters with a single form button.

* Cookies are only sent once if enabled, preventing annoying
  multiple warnings if the user has them turned on.

* If the user is going through multiple proxy servers (as
  AOL users do), the session will be stable.

* If REMOTE_USER is present, the IP address will not be
  used for the session name, allowing the same user to connect
  to a saved session from any machine.

* Many other minor bug fixes, improvements, and changes.
