<b>Algorithm:</b> A step-by-step problem-solving procedure, especially an established, recursive computational procedure for solving a problem in a finite number of steps.

<p>
<b>API:</b> Abbreviation of application program interface, a set of routines, protocols, and tools for building software applications. A good API makes it easier to develop a program by providing all the building blocks. A programmer puts the blocks together.  Most operating environments, such as MS-Windows, provide an API so that programmers can write applications consistent with the operating environment. Although APIs are designed for programmers, they are ultimately good for users because they guarantee that all programs using a common API will have similar interfaces. This makes it easier for users to learn new programs. (Definition obtained at <ahref="http://webopedia.internet.com/TERM/A/API.html">Webopedia</a>.)
<p>
<b>Archiving orders:</b> A process through which you can remove your orders from immediate view on your management administrator without deleting the record.
