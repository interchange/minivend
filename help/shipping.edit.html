<b>Name of this method</b><br>
This is the internal name used for the shipping method, and should be a single
word, like "air1".

<p>

<b>Label for this method</b><br>
The name you specify here will appear in the list of available shipping 
methods shown to shoppers when they place orders.  Take care to make them 
easy-to-understand.  The name you enter should reflect the shipping algorithm 
you choose.

<b>Calculate based on this algorithm</b></br>
Choose from:
<p>
Standard shipping by price: shipping total based on the total price of the 
order.  This can also be used to calculate a flat shipping price ($0 - 
infinity = $4.95) or a flat rate with big orders shipped free ($0 - 500 = $4.95
 and $500 - infinity = free).  The shipping charge can either be a flat charge 
or a percentage.

<p>
Standard shipping by weight: calculates shipping by total weight.  To use this 
method, you must enter a weight for each item in your inventory.  You can use 
any unit of measure you wish as long as you are consistent:  if you enter your 
item prices in grams then configure shipping with pounds, your customers will 
not be happy when they are quoted huge shipping rates. 

<p>
<a name="quantity">Standard by quantity:</a> charges an amount according to 
how many items are ordered.

<p>
<a href="shipping.ups.html">UPS zones-based:</a>  Interchange is pre-configured
 with UPS zones tables for ground, three day select, second day air, and next 
day air.  If you require zones support for Fedex, DHL, or USPS, please 
<a href="mailto:information@akopia.com">contact Akopia.</a>

<p>
<b>Minimum shipping charge</b><br>
The amount you enter into this field will be the minimum allowed quote for 
that particular shipping method.  For example, if you want to charge no less 
than $4.50 for ground shipping, enter "4.5" or "4.50" into this field.  
Remember, you must set the minimum for each of your shipping methods, if you 
want each to have a minimum charge.

<p>
<a name="additional"><b>Additional shipping calculation</b><br></a>

Here, you can enter any additional calculation you would like to apply to the 
shipping calculation.  This is especially useful for the zones-based 
shipping calculations.  Very few merchants pay the full rates for UPS 
shipping, and some merchants want to slightly mark up their shipping charges 
for handling.  Other merchants may want to discount them slightly to promote 
goodwill.  This feature would allow you to discount your UPS ground shipping 
quote by 25% to match your discount, then add $2.50 to cover a packaging and 
handling charge.  Tip:  if you're currently not receiving a discount on your 
shipping rates, call UPS and ask for one.
