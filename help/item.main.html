<b>Create New item</b><br>

When creating a new item, first specify an item type in the pull-down menu. This will then determine the fields that show up when an item is made. For example, if one of your item types is books, you would be asked the title, author, and publisher. However, if one of the item types was toys, you would be asked for product name and brand.  These product types can be made using the <a href="type.manager.html">type manager </a>  See also:  <a href="create.edit.item.html">Create/edit item</a>.
<p>
If you do not see a pull-down menu with item types next to the "create new item" button, then there is only one item type set up for your store.  By default, there should be several item types set up, so the administrator who configured Interchange probably made the decision to remove extra item types.  If there is only one item type available, then creating items will be even easier.
<p>
If you have questions about the specific item types listed in the pull-down menu, consult the list of default item types. If the types you see do not match the defaults, ask the administrator who configured Interchange for you.
<p>


<b>What is a Matrix?</b><br>
A matrix is a table of all the possible combinations of options available for an item.  For example, a golf club can have options for mens and ladies, right and left handed, several shaft types and flexes, and different lofts, or head angles.  But not all lofts are available in left handed, and some aren't available in ladies, and graphite shafts cost extra and all have different SKUs.  The matrix contains all the variables.  A simple matrix might be a size matrix, which has small, medium, large, and extra large.  You would then be able to apply a unique sku or price or inventory information to each variation of each item.

<p>

<b>Please Select a matrix for new item</b> (only shows up if matrixes have been created.)<br>
If you or your system administrator have set up product matrixes for various product types, a pull-down menu will appear next to the "create new item" button.  When creating a new product, you can specify that it will use a particular product matrix (or use no matrix).  
<p>
You can create matrixes in the <a href="matrix.editor.html">matrix editor</a>. See the matrix editor help page for more information

<p>

<b>Edit item</b><br>
Select an item from the list before clicking on "edit item." The screen will look the same as the create new item, but the fields will be ready to edit. For the changes to be recorded, click on the OK button at the bottom of the edit item screen. Using the browser's back button to exit the screen is fine, but the changes will not be recorded. Using the back button has the same effect as clicking on the cancel button.  See also:  <a href="create.edit.item.html">Create/edit item</a>.

<p>

<b>Delete Item</b><br>
Select an item from the list that you would like to delete, and click on Delete. You will be asked for confirmation. If the choice is confirmed the item will be deleted -- permanently.
<p>

<b>Change Matrix</b> (only displayed if matrixes have been created)<br>
If you havve assigned a particular matrix to a product and you would like to assign a different matrix or use no matrix, select the product from the list then press this button.  You will then be prompted to choose the new matrix for the product, or "none"

<p>

<b>Edit All Variations</b><br> (only displayed if matrixes have been created)<br>
Since product variations in a matrix can all have different price, sku, and inventory information, in order to edit a product with a detailed matrix, you have to edit each variation individually.  That could be a time consuming process, so we designed the "edit all variations" function, which would allow you to change an attribute of a product across all variations, even if there are 300 different options.  
<p>
If, for example, there was a matrix created titled "Sweatshirts" and the manufacturer increased the wholesale price of all sweatshirts by 5%, the Edit All Variation button would allow all prices of sweatshirts to be increased by 5% regardless of size. Therefore, instead of editing each individual sweatshirt, this button allows the entire matrix to be edited all at once.
<p>
Caution: if you charge more for x-large sweatshirts and you use this function on the sweatshirt, it will change the price of all the varitations to the same price, and you would then need to manually edit the prices of the x-large sweatshirts.
