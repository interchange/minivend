There are several options available for Interchange users who need technical assistance.  Because Tallyman is open source software, experienced developers have the power to download and edit its source code in order to make changes.  Most Tallyman users, however, will find that the easiest and most cost-effective way to handle their day-to-day questions and needs will be to tap Akopia's expertise.  Following is an outline of the various support and consulting services that Akopia has to offer.
<p>
<b>Free Self-Service </b> 
<A HREF="http://www.sourceforge.net/project/?form_grp=488">Sourceforge</A>:  The Interchange sourceforge site has forums and bug tracking, in addition to sites to download the latest versions via FTP or check out a copy of the source code via CVS.  Akopia staffers monitor the discussion forum and will offer help at no cost.
<p>
<b>Email-based technical support</b>
Akopia stays in business because of services revenue, and technical support fees are one of our primary sources of income.  Nevertheless, during our developer release, email-based technical support is free.  If you have problems with installation, configuration, or use of Interchange, email <A HREF="mailto:support@tallyman.com">support@tallyman.com</A>.  Once we do our general release, users will still be able to email support@tallyman.com with problems, but they may need to enter into a support contract before we can offer substantial, time-consuming assistance.  Easy questions will still be answered free.
<p>
We endeavor to answer all email within 24 hours.  Email sent during business hours is often answered within one hour.
<p>
<b>Per-incident technical support</b>
Interchange users who need assistance over the phone can purchase support by the incident for $49.  A tech support "incident" is defined as the resolution of one technical question, problem or issue, regardless of the number of contacts with Akopia Technical Support required to resolve it.  During the resolution of one incident, users may call several times (or receive calls) over an extended period of time.  On the other hand, in some cases, several incidents can be covered in the course of one call.  The best example of such a scenario would be a complicated install, where Akopia support personnel would assist in the installation and configuration of several different software packages.   
<p>
If it is apparent that your technical support call may comprise several incidents, the Akopia staff member who takes your call will alert you to that fact and will probably give you a quote for the entire job that will be substantially lover than a strict per-incident charge.
<p>

<b>Ongoing technical support contracts</b>
Interchange users who would like the freedom to contact Akopia at any time without having to pay per-incident can open a technical support contract for a particular period of time or to perform a particular task.  Contracts are available in increments of one month, three months, and one year.  Pricing may vary depending on the platform and depending on the scope of the project.  A typical one month support contract will cost $100-300.
<p>

<b>Installation support</b>
Installing and configuring Interchange can be easy or hard, depending on the platform, the pre-configuration, and the degree of customization needed.  Installation support, therefore, falls into its own category and will generally be bid on a case by case basis.  Installation support can cost as little as $100.  In some cases, a complicated installation and configuration will fall under the category of Akopia's consulting services.  See the next section for more details.
