An affiliates program allows the merchant to make linking agreements with the 
owners of other web sites then track which orders come in from those off-site 
links.  In many cases, the partner site earn a percentage of the sale from 
that link.  In other cases, the merchant is simply interested in knowing how 
many people are buying as a result of a particular link.

<p>
<b>Create new affiliate</b><br>
Click this button to make a new affiliate.  You will be asked to give that 
affiliate a name.  This name will appear in your personal list of affiliates 
and will also appear on any orders resulting from this affiliate's links.  
After you submit the new affiliate information, Interchange will display a 
unique URL which you will need to email to your new affiliate.  They will 
receive credit for an order only if the purchaser originally clicked on that 
specific URL.

<p>
<b>Default URL to redirect to</b><br>
When setting up your affilate, you have the choice of having their link point 
to your front page, to any other page in your site, or perhaps to a welcome 
page specifically for that affiliate's customers. Enter the complete URL in 
this space.  Note:  do <i>not</i> enter the URL of the affiliate's web site in 
this space.

<p>
<b>Timeout delay</b><br>
The amount of time you enter here, in seconds, is the time that purchasers 
have between the time they enter your site through the link and when they must 
purchase before their status expires.  If you set this time to 60 seconds, 
most purchasers will not have time to place an order and your affiliate would 
not get credit for any of the sales.  We recommend a setting in the thousands, 
or a setting of zero, which disables this feature.

<p>
<b>Edit affiliate</b><br>
Select an affiliate's name from the list, and click "edit affiliate" to review 
or change the affiliate information.  If you forget the URL that the affiliate 
needs to use, it is displayed in the "edit affiliate" screen.

<p>
<b>Show orders</b><br>
This feature will review the number, amounts, and specifics of all orders 
attributed to a particular affiliate.  Select the affiliate from the list and 
click "show statsitics." 

<p>
<b>Show Traffic</b><br>
This button will allow you to view information on the number of visitors who
have come to your site via the selected affiliate.

<p>
<b>Delete affiliate</b><br>
Select the affiliate from the list and click "delete affiliate" to remove it.  
You will be asked to confirm your choice, after which it can not be recovered.

<p>
<b>Affiliate Relations</b><br>
You may also choose to allow the affiliate to view the statistics for the 
traffic on your site to which they are responsible.  You can do this by 
allowing them a restricted amount of access. (See the <a href="access.main.html"
>Access Manager</a> for details.)

<p>
Note:  the affiliates feature requires that the purchaser's computer accept 
cookies.  Keep in mind that some purchasers may have their browsers set to 
reject cookies or may be using browsers that do not support them.
