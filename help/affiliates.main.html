An affiliates program allows the merchant to make linking agreements with the
owners of other web sites then track which orders coming in came from those
off-site links.  In many cases, the partner site would then earn a percentage
of the sale from that link.  In other cases, the merchant is simply interested
in knowing how many people are buying as a result of a particular link.

<p>
<b>Create new affiliate</b><br>
Click this button to make a new affiliate.  You will be asked to give that
affiliate both a code and a name. The name will appear in your personal list of
affiliates and will also appear on any orders resulting from this affiliate's
links.  After you submit the new affiliate information, Interchange will
display a unique URL which you will need to email to your new affiliate.  They
will receive credit for an order only if the purchaser originally clicked on
that specific URL.

<p>
<b>Default URL to redirect to</b><br>
When setting up your affiliate, you have the choice of having their link point
at your front page, to any other page in your site, or perhaps to welcome page
specifically for that affiliate's customers. Enter the complete URL in this
space.  Note:  do <i>not</i> enter the URL of the affiliate's web site in this
space.
<p>
<b>Timeout delay</b><br>
The amount of time you enter here, in seconds, is the time that purchasers have
between the time they enter your site through the link and when they must
purchase before their status expires.  If you set this time to 60 seconds, most
purchasers will not have time to place an order and your affiliate would not
get credit for any of the sales.  We recommend a setting in the thousands, or a
setting of zero, which disables this feature.
<p>
<b>Edit affiliate</b><br>
Select an affiliate's name from the list, and click "edit affiliate" to review
or change the affiliate information.  If you forget the URL that the affiliate
needs to use, it is displayed in the "edit affiliate" screen.
<p>
<b>Show order statistics</b><br>
This feature will review the number, amounts, and specifics of all orders
attributed to a particular affiliate.  Select the affiliate from the list and
click "show statistics." 
<p>
<b>Show traffic statistics</b><br>
This feature will review:
	<UL>
	<LI>Number of visits attributed to the affiliate
	<LI>Number of page views and percent of visits resulting in a page view
	<LI>Number of product views and percent of visits resulting in a product view
	<LI>Number of items placed in the cart and percent of visits resulting in a
	product view
	<LI>Number of orders and percentage of visitors ordering
	</UL>
Note that the percentages will not appear to match up -- it is not the number of
product views divided by the number of visits, but the number of visitors doing
a product view.

<p>
<b>Delete affiliate</b><br>
Select the affiliate from the list and click "delete affiliate" to remove it.
You will be asked to confirm your choice, after which it can not be recovered.

<p>
Note:  the affiliates timeout delay feature requires that the purchaser's
computer accept cookies.  Keep in mind that some purchasers may have their
browsers set not reject cookies or be using browsers that do not support them.
