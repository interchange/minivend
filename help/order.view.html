All on-line orders received are displayed in the Order Manager. The Order Manager  works in real-time, therefore it will display all currently completed orders.  However, the page must be re-loaded periodically to see the most recent orders if you leave the page open or your web browser has cached the page's contents. 
<p>


Archived orders/Pending orders<br>
By default, the order manager shows the pending orders, that is, orders that have not yet been archived. So see the archived orders, click on the archived orders button.  To return to pending orders, press the pending orders button.

<p>

OrderID/date/total<br>
By default, orders are listed by orderID, top to bottom. Orders can also be listed by date or total amount simply by clicking on the appropriate choice in the header.  Click on total and they will be listed from largest to smallest.

<p>

View order<br>
To view an item from the list, select it, then click on view order. All personal information (name, address, phone number), payment information (credit, C.O.D., etc.), and order information (items ordered, options selected, shipping, tax, and total), will be displayed.

<p>

Archive order<br>
Select an order from the list and click on the archive order button to move it to the archived orders list. Archived orders can be kept for as long as you want. They will be accessible online.  Alternately, you may choose to simply delete the orders after you have filled them.
<p>

Delete Order<br>
If order information is stored somewhere else, simply delete the order from Interchange. The order will still be recorded in the order statistics.

<p>

Delete False Order<br>
Periodically, either through fraud or because an order fell through after it was placed due to product availability problems, an order will need to be deleted and not reported in the order statistics. Select the false order from the list and click on the delete false order button. You will be asked for confirmation to delete this order, because once an order is deleted, it is irretrievable.

<p>

What do I do if I have deleted an order that I need?<br>
You should have received an email confirmation of the order which contains information about the order including the items ordered and the email address and phone number of the customer. Try emailing or calling the customer and have them tell you their credit card number over the telephone.
