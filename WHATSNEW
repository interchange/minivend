                  What's new in each version of Interchange
                       (since the version 5.0 branch)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 5.1.0 not yet released.

Core
----

* Disallow [ and < in page names when setting MV_PAGE and MV_PREV_PAGE
  variables.

* Move mv_nextpage fallback before security check.

* Add the ability to create a transaction ID and later assign the order number.
  To use, you need to set in the main route:

	  counter_tid    etc/transaction.number

  At that point, in the current foundation, you would add this code to
  assign an order number *after* payment is taken.

	Set order number in values: [value
                        name=mv_order_number
                        set="[counter
                                name=`$Session->{current_route}{counter_name}
										|| 'etc/order.number'
									 `
                                sql=`$Session->{current_route}{sql_counter}`
                                start=`$Session->{current_route}{first_order_number}`
                                date=`$Session->{current_route}{date_counter}`
                            ]"
                    ]
	Set order number in session: [calc]
                        $Session->{mv_order_number} = $Values->{mv_order_number};
                    [/calc]

  This allows the order numbers to increment only after payment has been
  received, while still allowing the all-in-one transaction logging
  file located in a report file.

  If you use counter_tid, you *must* set set the order number in your
  logging file if you want it to be available.

  You will want to call [charge ... order_id="[value mv_transaction_id]"]
  to get full traceability of declined and failed charges.

* Add ability to use date-based order numbers with

		date_counter   1

  in the appropriate route.

* Allow setting a counter name without incrementing the counter itself, if

		increment   0

  is in the route. This is really how it should have been done in the
  first place.

* Remove Vend::Server::http_log_msg which is only called for SOAP accesses.

UserTag
-------

* Add option to specify useragent to get_url tag.

UI
--

* customer_mailing: Add full path for sendmail in batch, 
  using $Config->{SendMailProgram}, weed duplicate email addresses, 
  sort by email instead of last name 

Foundation
----------

* Remove "default" column from mv_metadata.asc, as it is not used anywhere.
  This allows the addition of mv_metadata to MySQL, as otherwise the
  column name "default" prevents the creation of the table.

TableEditor
-----------

* Apply Paul Vinciguerra's patch to number of rows thing, which gets multiple row
  tabs working on the tabbed display if not in ui_style mode.

Options
-------

* Add blank_label="--select--" option to [item-options], allows development
  of code to enforce option selection.

i18n
----

* "make localefiles" ignores CVS conflict files now

Debian
------

* Add libhtml-parser-perl to Build-Depends to keep HTML::Entities
  module out of the package (Closes: #224435, thanks to Henrik Holmboe
  <elements@hack.se> for the bug report)
