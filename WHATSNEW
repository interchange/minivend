                  What's new in each version of Interchange
                       (since the version 4.8 branch)

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 5.0.0 not yet released.

Core
----

* On 2002-10-21 Canada Post changed symbol NF to NL to reflect the province of
  Newfoundland changing its name to "Newfoundland and Labrador". For details
  see:

  http://www.canadapost.ca/personal/corporate/about/announcements/newpcode-e.asp

  The "province" profile check will now accept both NF and NL, but NF is now
  deprecated and will be removed in a future release.

Usertags
--------

* [formel] fetches the label for the display type from the metadata if not passed
  with the parameters.

Foundation
----------

* Change Newfoundland from NF to NL in "state" table.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 4.9.9 released 2003-10-31.

Core
----

* Remove long-deprecated %Safe hash. Use $CGI, $Carts, $Items, $Config,
  $Scratch, and $Values instead of $Safe{cgi} etc.

* Fix locking of NFS sessions.

* Make [bounce ...] more reliable with respect to terminating output
  and future parsing.

* Send Content-Size header with downloads.

* Add MD5 password support to UserDB. 
  To activate, use UserDB "md5" option, i.e.:

	UserDB   ui   md5   1

* Make $Tag object be rebuilt every time a new page is done.

* Fix bug in [PREFIX-discount-subtotal] where quantity was greater
  than one. We were overloading the discount_price() routine, which
  was dumb, so a new discount_subtotal() routine takes over.

* Add iso_time and null_time options for updating UserDB time_field:

	UserDB  default  null_time    1
	UserDB  default  iso_time     1

* Add stubs for log_error and errstr routines in the database
  modules.

* Fix for broken getppid() on Linux systems with threads enabled.
  To implement, use

        Variable   MV_GETPPID_BROKEN   1

  in interchange.cfg. It substitutes a syscall(64) for the getppid
  call.

  This should only be necessary on systems with threads enabled,
  which is NOT recommended for IC.

* Allow overriding LENGTH_EXCEPTION_DEFAULT with individual LENGTH_EXCEPTION.
  This just makes LENGTH_EXCEPTION accept values like:

  	Database transactions LENGTH_EXCEPTION_DEFAULT  truncate_log
  	Database transactions LENGTH_EXCEPTION          update_date=ignore

* Don't run set_defaults at all for a subcatalog, as they should be set
  for the base catalog.

* Allow for SELECT statements in parentheses or other non-word characters.

* Enable [order] tag to specify a variant, not just a base product, when
  options are in use, e.g.:

  [order code="ABCD" variant="ABCD-XYZ"]Buy now</a>

* Fix a problem where the following worked:

		$Tag->price({ code => $sku });

  but the following failed:

		$Tag->price($sku);

  The problem was highlighted by Paul Vinciguerra, in IRC.

* Add date-based counter capability to Vend::CounterFile.

  -- In a database, you just add

	   Database tablename AUTO_NUMBER_DATE 1

     To have real autonumbering, you still must define AUTO_NUMBER.
     This of course does not work with AUTO_SEQUENCE.

     You must make sure your key field type is at least 12 chars.

  -- In a counter tag, you do:

	   [counter file=filename.ctr date=local]

         or

  	   $Tag->counter({ file => $fn, date => 'local'});

     To define GMT as being used for the numbering, you do:

	   [counter file=filename.ctr date=gmt]

* Fix problems that GDBM and some other types would not honor HIDE_AUTO_FILES.

* Allow an ActionMap, Autoload, or profile to generate a completely
  virtual page and avoid readin() of anything.

* Fix bug that prevented [loop-change foo] from working when the range of
  conditions was only 0 and 1.

* Add no_set boolean option to [userdb], which prevents userdb row from
  being set with values.

* Don't throw away UseModifier cart modifiers on every cart update.
  They can still be updated via CGI mv_item_option if it's set.

* Remove insurance of trailing null fields being included in arrays.
  Any traversing of the arrays should be keyed on code/sku anyway,
  and that is the only one that needs to be fully populated.

  Fix provided by Brian Rogers of Groxis -- caused problems for one
  of his custom ordering routines.

* Allow return of page from readin (or readfile in locale mode) without
  the locale language substitutions done. This allows proper edits of
  pages.

* Allow set of status header even when not doing redirect.

* Fix double-setting of Content-Type header, use proper header
  setting routine.

* Never set a cookie when mv_tmp_session in effect.

* Add DeliverImage directive that enables fast IC delivery of
  images requested from it.

  To enable, do in catalog.cfg:

  	DeliverImage  Yes

  If the file extension is present and the MimeType for that extension
  begins with "image/", the path will be adjusted to add ImageDir
  or ImageDirSecure, and a 302 issued.

  This happens before database or session opens, and is quite fast.

  Sets $Vend::tmp_session so no cookie is issued.

* Make frequently-used HTML::Entities encode_entities routine available
  to embedded Perl.

* Allow timed_build to autocreate directory path when filename with path
  component is specified. This makes it easier to do dynamic directories
  based on CGI parameters etc. when there are thousands of timed build
  files. E.g.:

  [timed-build file="timed/@@MV_PAGE@@/[item-code]" minutes=86400] ...

* Avoid cluttering of global logs with 
  'Attempt to call perl from within Safe'.

* Fix prefork problem that might be biting someone, could cause missing
  filters.

* Add ability to access and test the $opt hash for any search
  loop.

  [loop prefix=top list="a b c"]
	[loop list="1 2 3" foo-opt="[top-code]"]
		[if-loop-header-param foo_opt]
			Foo is there! It is: [loop-header-param foo_opt]
		[/if-loop-header-param]

		[if-loop-header-param !foo_opt]
			Foo is NOT there! It is: [loop-header-param foo_opt]
		[/if-loop-header-param]

		[if-loop-header-param foo_opt eq a]
			Foo is equal to a.
		[else]
			Foo is NOT equal to a.
		[/else]
		[/if-loop-header-param]
		<br>
    [/loop]
	<p>
  [/loop]

* Add module-version intrinsic test:

	<input	name=mv_column_op
			type=hidden
			value="[if module-version Text::Query]aq[else]rm[/else][/if]"
			>

* Enhance [PREFIX-alternate] to support

	[PREFIX-alternate]              Defaults to [value mv_item_alternate] or 2 (same)
	[PREFIX-alternate N]            Alternate every N items (same)
	[PREFIX-alternate except_last]  Every time except last in list
	[PREFIX-alternate except_first] Every time except last in list
	[PREFIX-alternate first_only]   Only on the first item
	[PREFIX-alternate last_only]    Only on the last item
	[PREFIX-alternate 0]            Alias for first_only
	[PREFIX-alternate -1]           Alias for except_last

* Move handling of anchor option from tag_area to vendURL.

* Add new facility for storing address books in outboard address table,
  instead of an in-record hash, and start framework for adding different
  personalities to UserDB.

* Move UserDB's "logout" function to a subroutine so that it can be inherited.

* Add RedirectCache directive which allows redirected page requests to
  be set to mv_tmp_session then written to the target from which it was
  redirected. This allows a complete web site to be mirrored to static
  HTML as it is requested, accompanied with the proper setting of
  AcceptRedirect in Interchange and ErrorDocument in the Apache server.

  To use:

  	   * Set ErrorDocument 404 to the Interchange URL in Apache.

	   * Set "AcceptRedirect Yes" in interchange.cfg.

	   * Set "RedirectCache /var/www/html" in interchange.cfg (use
	     your document root in place of /var/www/html).

  When a page http://yourdomain.tld/subdir/page.html is not found,
  Interchange gets a redirect which causes it to set mv_tmp_session=1.
  If Interchange doesn't find the page, then it returns "missing" and
  no writing is done. If IC does find the page, it is written to
  /var/www/html/subdir/page.html and the page will be found on next
  access.

  Exclude on HTTP server side can be done with permissions -- don't set
  it writable by IC daemon if you don't want it written.

* Fix problem where defining blank GlobalSub would kill *all* globalsubs.

* Never issue a session ID on timed-build URL.

* Remove conditional for caching history on Pragma: no-cache -- this is
  all wrong. The directive is to this page transaction of Interchange,
  i.e. timed-build and such. It should not be used to prevent building
  of history, partly because browsers may send it for their own reason.

* Prevent autovivification of $CGI::values{mv_username}, and make CookieLogin
  slightly more efficient when already logged in.

* Allow custom increment and decrement routines with inc-routine and
  dec-routine options. They can be an inline code reference:

	[counter
		file=testcount
		inc-routine=`sub { shift(@_) + 2 }`
	]
	[counter
		file=testcount
		decrement=1
		dec-routine=`sub { shift(@_) - 2 }`
	]

  or a Sub or GlobalSub:

	catalog.cfg:
  	Sub three_steps_forward <<EOR
	sub {
		my $val = shift; $val += 3; return $val;
	}
	EOR

  	Sub two_steps_back <<EOR
	sub {
		my $val = shift; $val -= 2; return $val;
	}
	EOR

	[counter file=testcount inc-routine=three_steps_forward]
	[counter file=testcount dec-routine=two_steps_back decrement=1]

* Add [error auto=1] similar to [warnings auto=1].

* Fix nested [elsif] problem.

* Fix problem with alphabetic sorting of more lists where search results
  appeared in the wrong group.

* Add delimiter option to checked/selected tags. Patch provided by
  Mat Jones <mat@thinkopensource.com>.

* Implement Paul Vinciguerra's suggestion to not save mv_password in
  the History hash.

  You can also set up a different NoHistory set via

  	@Vend::Dispatch::NoHistory = qw/ foo bar mv_credit_card_number /;

Tables
------

* Set up error reporting to be able to catch database errors
  and display in session, catalog error.log, or global error.log

    1. Logging levels are on a per-table basis, with
       defaults that can be set with DatabaseDefault:

        DatabaseDefault  LOG_ERROR_CATALOG  1
        DatabaseDefault  LOG_ERROR_SESSION  1
        DatabaseDefault  LOG_ERROR_GLOBAL   0
        DatabaseDefault  DIE_ERROR          0

    2. Log errors to the catalog error.log by default.

        Database  inventory LOG_ERROR_CATALOG  0|1*

    3. Log errors to the session always if an admin, and
       controlled by configuration if not.

        Database  inventory LOG_ERROR_SESSION  0|1*

       This has the effect of giving a big red error message when such
       an event as failing to create a record occured. In most cases,
       you would be able to use the <-Back button and fix the error
       and resubmit.

       The error tag is "table foo", where foo is the table.

    4. Die at the page level (500 error) only if that is explicit
       request in config for that table:

        Database  inventory  DIE_ERROR  0*|1

    5. Log errors globally only on explicit request:

        Database  inventory LOG_ERROR_GLOBAL   0*|1

    6. LENGTH_EXCEPTION errors go into warnings if they are handled
       with truncate.

      * default

* Fix numeric sorting in SQL statements if a field is NUMERIC.

* Allow limits from SQL statement to flow through even if ml="" is set
  and let direct_sql.html admin page honor them.

* Fix table names so that we don't have the funky .txt problems
  where a SQL query would not work on a DBM database unless
  the file name base matched the table name.

* Attempt to regularize error messages so that they can be
  more easily translated. Now should have about 50% less
  variations.

* Prevent internal server error when $db->row($key) fetches no results
  within DBI module.

* Fix bug in DBI module that caused arbitrary column to get set 
  to primary key instead of to the intended new value.

* Add internal Interchange locking routines and support for GDBM. (Should
  work on others as well but is not tested.)

  To set internal locking, just put in the config:

  	Database access IC_LOCKING 1

  On GDBM, employs the GDBM_NOLOCK parameter.

  It should prevent the errors in access.gdbm when multiple admins are
  logged in. It might also serve to make userdb in GDBM somewhat usable.

Search
------

* Add Altavista-style search operator with Text::Query (CPAN) module.
  Calls Text::Query::*AdvancedString with op=aq, calls
  Text::Query::*SimpleString with op=tq.

  Examples:

    [loop search="
                se=hammer -framing
                sf=description
                fi=products
                st=db
                co=yes
                rf=*
                op=tq
            "]
    [loop-code] [loop-param description]<br>
    [/loop]

    [loop search="
                se=hammer NEAR framing
                sf=description
                fi=products
                st=db
                co=yes
                rf=*
                op=aq
            "]
    [loop-code] [loop-param description]<br>
    [/loop]

  Honors mv_case (-case option), mv_all_chars (-regexp option),
  mv_substring_match (-whole option) and mv_exact_match
  (-litspace option).

* Add ability to map in custom search routines. In interchange.cfg:

    CodeDef find_hammer SearchOp find_hammer
    CodeDef find_hammer Routine <<EOR
    sub {
        my($self, $i, $string, $opname);
    #::logDebug("Calling fake SearchOp");
        return sub {
    #::logDebug("testing with fake SearchOp");
            my $string = shift;
            $string =~ /hammer/i;
        };
    }
    EOR

   Now you can do:

    [loop search="
                se=hammer NOT framing
                sf=description
                fi=products
                st=db
                co=yes
                rf=*
                op=find_hammer
            "]
    [loop-code] [loop-param description]<br>
    [/loop]

   The passed parameters are:

        - The search object ($self)
        - The index into coordinated search array ($i)
        - The pattern to match
        - The name of the op (find_hammer in this case)

    Must return a sub which receives the data to match and returns
    1 if it matches. DOES NOT HONOR mv_negate UNLESS you tell it to.

    See Vend::Search::create_text_query for an example of how to
    return a proper routine and look in search object for the
    associated params.

Payment
-------

* CCVS payment module removed.

* Add support for Canadian PSiGate gateway. Thanks to Gary Benson for his
  work and testing.

* Fix potential PreFork problems in AuthorizeNet module.

* Add a "x_ADC_Delim_Character" (set to \037, which is ASCII US)
  to replace the default field separator (,). A comma isn't a
  very useful default, as people tend to use them in their address.
  Problem reported, and fix tested, by John Young in IRC.

Shipping
--------

* Don't cache zero UPS shipping cost.

* UPS no longer accepts UK as a country code for shipments to
  Great Britain.

   -- did an exception remap for UK --> GB

   -- Added UPS_COUNTRY_REMAP code so that this type of thing
      can be done elsewhere.

        # Remap Monaco to France for UPS
        Variable  UPS_COUNTRY_REMAP   MC=FR

* Add ability to build weight adjustments based on Simple options
  settings. Requires a "weight" field in the options table.

* Add hide_error option to suppress error message when no shipping methods
  are found.

* Allow comment lines in shipping.asc, with leading # mark.

UI
--

* Add missing user and password to SQL DUMP COMMAND in xfer_catalog
  UserTag.

* Remove the Term modules from checks -- they have nothing to do with
  IC operation and Term::ReadKey can cause core dumps.

* Remove extra <html> from templates.

* Force name to text variable, so numerical-only names will not cause
  crash when a string function is done.

* Minor improvements in backup setup.

	-- Let backup tables be explicitly specified in
       UI_BACKUP_TABLES.

    -- If no UI_BACKUP_TABLES, honor first "backup" then
       "!display_filter" in table metadata.

    -- Display size of downloadable file.

	-- Prevent spurious .html extension on download link.

* Add meta_editor support for MAXLENGTH and JavaScript checks.

* Made default metadata (for merge) match foundation.

* Fix inability to set and retain multiple user groups with fix
  provided by Sonny Cook.

* Prevent display of meta database when relocated from meta editor.

* Write the selected PGP/GPG key to the Variable table setting.

* Missing session id added to form in various admin pages
  (thanks to Paul Vinciguerra <pvinci@vinciguerra.com> for the patch).

* Add check to disallow invalid option names.

* Old-style simple option updates were ineffective because the
  "Commit Changes" button's mv_nextpage was set to "admin/item"
  instead of @@MV_PAGE@@.

* Allow tracking number to be updated on ship. 
  Fix contributed by Sebastian Braun.

* Get rid of strange extra loop for billing information in customer_view
  pages that just caused extra queries for [bill-data userdb ...] calls.

* Check whether userdb is LARGE instead of transactions on customer page.

* Ensure that secure mode is forced before we bounce to login.

* Fix the long-standing problem that sorts and groupings would not
  work on query-by-example search returns.

* Fix problem with creating new option when no prior options exist.
  Fix found by Reid Sutherland (reid-ic@thirddimension.net).

* Add ability to edit pages using Mozilla composer, or any HTML editor
  that can publish with an HTTP put. Includes ability to upload images
  with the files, create new files, and more.

* ONLY operates on the area between <!-- BEGIN CONTENT --> and
  <!-- END CONTENT -->.

* Pulls the page title from the <title></title> of the PUT page.

* If a new page is PUT, it is wrapped with the template used in
  the nearest DirectoryIndex ("index" by default). If a new file
  "trucks/chevy/mom.html" is created and does not exist, the following
  files will be used as the template in this order if they exist:

    trucks/chevy/index
    trucks/index
    index

* Update [if-mm ...] to have a "pagematch" and "filematch" function
  that allows security checks based on the files and pages fields
  in the access table. This allows certain users to have publish
  permission only on certain image and page directories. For
  instance, if the user "bubba" is only to edit files in the
  "trucks" hierarchy, you would want in access:

    username:bubba
    files:images/trucks/
    pages:trucks/

* Add action "admin_publish" that handles the PUT process. Requires
  user be logged in as an admin, and requires

* Automatic RCS versioning if PUBLISH_DO_RCS variable is set. Can
  stop publish if RCS error when PUBLISH_QUIT_ON_RCS_ERROR Variable
  is set.

* Adding "ui_mozilla_edit=1" to the URL keeps ITL tags from being
  interpolated within the BEGIN CONTENT/END CONTENT area. This
  allows

* Automatically adjusts image paths in the uploaded file to be
  relative to the directory the page is in. This allows individual
  directories to use different sets of images and Mozilla won't
  willy-nilly overwrite things in other directories.

* Can prevent any publishing to the pages root if PUBLISH_NO_PAGE_ROOT
  is set.

* Allow component modification via Mozilla editor.

  If you follow the "show tags" link (i.e. add ui_mozilla_edit=1 to
  the param list), it will output the current component set
  in meta headers:

  <meta name="component" content="1;component;search_box_small">
  <meta name="component" content="2;component;cart_tiny">
  <meta name="component" content="3;component;product_tree">
  <meta name="component" content="4;component;">
  <meta name="component" content="5;component;cross">
  <meta name="component" content="5;banner;Specials">
  <meta name="component" content="5;cols;2">
  <meta name="component" content="5;size;2">
  <meta name="component" content="6;component;random">
  <meta name="component" content="6;banner;See also...">
  <meta name="component" content="6;cols;1">
  <meta name="component" content="6;size;3">
  <meta name="component" content="7;component;">
  <meta name="component" content="8;component;">

  For instance, component 5 above is exactly equivalent to:

  	[control-set]
		[component]cross[/component]
		[banner][L]Specials[/component]
		[cols]2[/cols]
		[size]2[/size]
	[/control-set]

* Also turn on no_locale_parse in ui_mozilla_edit mode, so that
  locale-based information won't be lost.

* Add ability to manipulate any [set setting]value[/set] (tmpn?, seti also)
  via meta header edit on Mozilla.

  Same procedure, just add a meta_header:

  	<meta name=setting content="tmpn;setting_name;The setting value">

  and that setting will be modified accordingly.

  Does not remove settings, only sets the ones found in headers.

* Prevent linked forms et al from coming in from table metadata.

* Add [flex-select] tag, complete replacement for and enhancement to
  the admin/flex_select.html page in the UI.

* Each colunn can have individual sort settings, and can individually
  be specified to use alphabetic more lists when it is the sorting
  column. (ui_more_alpha, ui_sort_option)

* Group "magnifying glass" can be turned off in metadata. (fs_no_group)

* Filters can be specified in metadata instead of just ui_data_fields.
  (fs_display_filter)

* Links to other pages specifying the field value can be done
  easily. For example, to add a per-sku link on the products
  table to the item_options page, put in ui_data_fields

  	sku
	sku-options
	price
	description

  In the metadata for products::sku-options, do:

		'extended.fs_link_page' => 'admin/item_options',
		'extended.fs_link_parm' => 'item_id',
		'extended.fs_link_anchor' => 'Edit Options',

  That will produce:

   <a href="__CGI_URL__/admin/item_options?item_id=SKU">Edit Options</a>

  Can be shorthand-set in ui_data_fields with:

  	sku
	sku-admin/item_options:item_id:Edit Options
	price
	description

* Columns can be calculated values by putting embedded perl code in
  fs_data_calc. The current row hash (with all values in the select colums)
  is put in $Vend::Interpolate::item. You can set tables to be pre-opened
  in fs_data_tables.

  This code in products::prod_group::extended.fs_data_calc:

	if($item->{prod_group} eq $prev) {
		return "''";
	}
	else {
		return $prev = $item->{prod_group};
	}

  will produce ditto marks if a prod_group is duplicated.

* An explicit "edit record" link can be enabled. (explicit_edit)

* The edit link on the key column can be disabled. (no_code_link)

* Checkboxes can be disabled. (no_checkbox)

* Check All/Uncheck All JavaScript links can be automatically inserted.
  (check_uncheck_all)

* The lines can be numbered. (number_list)

* Header cell and data cell CSS is completely settable in metadata on a
  per-column basis.

		'extended.header_link_class' => 'Header row link CSS class',
		'extended.header_cell_class' => 'Header cell CSS class',
		'extended.header_cell_style' => 'Header cell CSS style',
		'extended.data_cell_class' => 'Data cell CSS class',
		'extended.data_cell_style' => 'Data cell CSS style',

  While no metadata edit is provided for data_cell_width, data_cell_height,
  data_cell_align, they would be honored if set.

  The header rows and data rows can be set in the table metadata:

		'extended.header_row_class' => 'Header row CSS class',
		'extended.header_row_style' => 'Header row CSS style',
		'extended.data_row_class_odd' => 'Data row CSS class, odd numbers',
		'extended.data_row_class_even' => 'Data row CSS class, even numbers',

* No longer check for Term::Readline and Term::ReadKey.

* Explicitly set filters to avoid mangling of promotions

* Don't allow user to change order number through order status page.

* Ensure that you don't leave secure server through metaconfig link.

* Remove obsolete wizard pages.

Form
----

* Honor flag telling we already have data.

* Honor "db" passed parameter in lookup_query.

* Add display type "labels" that is like "options" except it displays the
  labels instead of their codes.

* option_format widget now uses passed filter.

Menu
----

* Add cheesy auto_format page/URL detection facility to try and
  tolerate user-built menus a bit better. In particular, this will
  recognize a non http: anchored absolute URL and will tolerate
  anchors in the page name.

  Called with auto-format=1 as a param.

* Remove IE-specific bounding box code in flyout menus. Turns out that
  caused absolute positioning problems when the page was scrolled, and
  that the DOM standard code I developed for Mozilla works just fine
  on MSIE 6.

Table Editor
------------

* Fix sequential edit.

* Modified passing of {table} parameter in display for table editor,
  setting flag to prevent getting table data twice.

* Make lookup_query honor {db} parameter for selecting base table
  for lookup

* Lookup should now work internally to the table if no {db} spec'd

* Mozilla screwed up their CSS size passing like MSIE, so
  remove special things that made item editor/table editor automatically
  look better on Mozilla (without setting *_height and *_width explicitly).

* Added MAXLENGTH to things you can set in meta_editor

* Added MAXLENGTH to parameters honored by [display ...]/Vend::Form,
  without having to manipulate extra=" maxlength=22" stuff.

* Put hooks in for auto-JS checks in table editor / [display]

* Allow default opening of a particular tab by adding * to the end of the
  tab label.

	Overridden by explicit "start_at" option given in options/args.

* Further allow focus of editor to start at a particular field if
  it is marked with a *.

   ui_data_fields => q{

   			=General

			foo
			bar

			=Specific*

			buz
			baz*
		},

	The "Specific" tab will be presented open when the record is edited.
	The form focus will be at the "baz" field.

* Substitute placeholders in lookup_query (just like with prepend and append):

  _UI_TABLE_
  _UI_COLUMN_
  _UI_KEY_

  This allows foreign table lookup queries to be tailored for the record
  currently being edited in the table editor.

* Allow hidden fields to come from all_opts again (was disrupting
  surveys).

* Add new link_blank_auto setting for table linking. This has the
  effect of:

  -- Automatically using auto-numbering
  -- setting the foreign key column to match the key of the
     edited record (as you would have to do to return the row
     once entered)
  -- Making both those fields hidden and non-changeable.

* Make tabbed-display relative now that Mozilla supports this. Should make
  setting html-width and table-width in metadata moot.

* Don't focus on meta links when tabbing through form.

* Allow cancel_text to be set when in database edit mode.

Foundation
----------

* Add missing table variable in db lookup for pref_group to metadata.

* Remove test data from inventory::stock_message metadata.

* Update Oracle configuration files for new options.
  Supplied by Jason <ic@santabarbara.org>.

* Add HIDE_FIELD to products database definition, so products marked
  inactive will not be found in search.

* Add --[L]select state[/L]-- blank option to shipping address form.

* Add support for all IC-recognized credit card types.

* Removed obsolete log_entry route and etc/log_entry file.

* Remove inadvertent filter for variants::weight from
  metadata, resolving bug #534.

* Bring MV_DEFAULT_SEARCH_{TABLE,FILE} into catalog.cfg so it is easier
  to hunt down. We can't unset it in catalog_before.cfg because it will
  break just about every catalog out there.

* Add handling to mail receipt if applicable.

* Remove the "view_from" parameter undoubtedly messing up many product edits
  and add ui_more_alpha definition to metadata.

Usertags
--------

* New Usertag [debug].

* Add new makesize=NNxNN parameter to image Usertag which uses ImageMagick 
  mogrify command to build custom thumbnails on the fly.

  Used mogrify executable because of constant difficulty building and
  installing Image::Magick perl modules.

  Example on the foundation demo:

     [image src="items/os28004.gif" makesize=50x50]

  This will create __IMAGE_DIR__/items/50x50/os28004.gif and return:

     <img src="items/50x50/os28004.gif" height=50 width=50>

  The size is still determined by Image::Size.

* New Usertag [capture-page] to interpolate pages and dump to disk,
  usually called from Interchange jobs. Examples:

  [capture-page page=index file=static/index.html umask=022]

  [loop list="Levels,Rulers,Squares"]
  [capture-page page="[loop-code]" file="static/cats/[loop-code].html"
    scan="fi=products/st=db/co=yes/sf=category/se=[loop-code]" 
    auto_create_dir=1]
  [/loop]

* Allow database text files in subsidiary directories of products
  for [xfer-catalog] Usertag.

* Add form parameter to [history-scan] Usertag to avoid invalid
  and error-prone constructs like [history-scan]&collapseall=1.

* Add "no-computer" option to [fortune] Usertag in order to make the 
  fortune more palatable to non-geek sites.

  This is highly dependent on the fortune setup; this will work with
  fortune on RHL 7.x and 8.x.

* Add [css VARNAME] tag that automatically generates a varname.css file
  for use by <link rel=stylesheet href="/foundation/images/theme_css.css">.

* [history-scan] -- there should never be a leading / on page names sent
  to $Tag->area(), and they are removed all the time now.

* Add src_only option to [image] tag  to return just the image location 
  that normally goes in the src="..." attribute of the <img> tag.

Filters
-------

* new alpha filter to keep only alphabetics A-Z and a-z

* new filter pgbool which munges any value into a valid PostgreSQL boolean 
  to be used in a quotable string environment, with a hybrid of 
  Perl/Interchange/PostgreSQL truth rules:

	undef, '', F, f, false, 0 -> f
	everything else -> t

* new filter pgbooln which is the same as pgbool, except assume that undefs 
  will pass through as NULLs to whatever does the query:

	undef -> NULL
	'', F, f, false, 0 -> f
	everything else -> t

Jobs
----

* Set $CGI->{mv_tmp_session} to signal that a "robot" is in charge.

* filter option added for Job output

* Jobs are now listed and queued in $Global::RunDir/jobs instead
  of $Global::RunDir/reconfig

* Add global Jobs configuration directive:
 
  Jobs MaxLifetime 3600
  Jobs MaxServers  3

  After a job has been running for MaxLifetime seconds, it will be
  removed by next housekeeping run. The default MaxLifetime is 10
  minutes. This setting is only available if PIDcheck has been set.

  MaxServers is the number of jobs allowed to be run simulatenously,
  which should be significantly smaller than the value in the
  MaxServers directive to avoid unaccessibility of Interchange for
  users. The default for MaxServers is 1.

* Add job to automatically calculate topsellers.

SQL Parsing
-----------

* Add Vend::SQL_Parser module, eliminating need for SQL::Statement.

* Improved tolerance for re-routing queries with table-only option.

* Parses more SQL -- now can use IN and BETWEEN and translate those
  to IC search specs.

* Handles complex parenthesized queries properly.

* Reads LIMIT N and translates to mv_matchlimit.

* Tests added to regression tests to check parser.

* Fix several deficiencies in SQL parsing.

  -- Recognize IS [NOT] NULL and map to a search for the
     empty string.

  -- Allow verbatim passing of field names for GDBM types, allowing
     "select Variable from variable where Variable = ''" which
	 would not work before.

  -- Add VERBATIM_FIELDS definition to database types which need it.

  -- Add support for "select sometable as foo, othertable bar where ..."
     so that queries using it can be rerouted properly.

  -- Always set mv_min_string = 0, so we don't have to do anything
     special for "where column = ''" and such.

i18n
----

* Update Italian UI translation.

SOAP
----

* Fix tree option in soap_entity tag.

* Enable calling of catalog usertags in SOAP actions.

Debian
------

* Drop Build-Depends on libdb2-dev to allow builds on woody and sid,
  apache-dev already has the proper dependency (Closes: #198136)

* Fix hang of build process caused by non-existant user interchange
  (Closes: #202063, thanks to Adrian Bunk <bunk@fs.tum.de> for his
  bugreport and help to trace down the problem) 

* Install manual pages in the correct location.
  
* Avoid lintian warning in interchange-ui package.

* Mark update_locales job as conffile.

* Fix bashisms in interchange-cat-foundation's config script.

* Don't throw an error if removal of the file 
  /usr/lib/interchange/auto/Interchange/.packlist fails
  (Closes: #215003, thanks to Daniel Schepler
  <schepler@math.berkeley.edu> for the bug report)

* Add versioned dependency on debconf to interchange-cat-foundation
  (Closes: #215633).

Miscellaneous
-------------

* Allow wildchar(*) in Swish search.

* Various minor cleanup, prevents warnings on startup.

* Call tracking functions only if Vend::Track object exists.

* Label first section of the POD documentations in the modules
  as NAME, this is common, looks nicer in man and helps to
  fix Debian Bug #203926.

* Add POD documentation to findtags.PL.

* Search for literal strings in bar_link, rather than treating them as
  regexes. Fix from Paul Vinciguerra. 

* Use 127.0.0.1 instead of localhost for default INET host values to avoid
  DNS lookup, as per bug #516.

* Remove abandoned "newcat" script from distribution.

* Convert nonstandard != to standard SQL <> (which also avoids a parse
  error in the new Vend::SQL_Parser) within options stuff.

* Add option to RPM spec file for /usr/local/bin/perl to work around threaded 
  vendor perls.

Extensions
----------

* Quickbooks updates:

  - Updated documentation.
  
  - Installation fixes.
  
  - Rewrite of the IIF generation query page:
    - Can query by order number range, date range, or "since last generation"
    - Allow specification of QuickBooks invoice number to be used 
      and incremented during IIF generation.
    - Filters out deleted orders.
  
  - IIF Generation changes:
    - Use the country name instead of the country code.
    - Some filter updates (the period is not as dangerous as it looks).


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 4.9.8 released 2003-06-19.


Core
----

* Allow [PREFIX-more-list] ... [/PREFIX-more-list] for nested loops.

* Support sparsely-populated quantity pricing tables.

* Fix bug in field name ranges in CommonAdjust where q99..q101 was handled
  as a Perl alphanumeric range q99, r00, r01, r02, etc. instead of
  q99, q100, q101.

* Remove wrong default for DatabaseDefault, could cause error when a
  DatabaseDefault value had not been previously set.

* Renamed Cron configuration directive to Jobs because that is a more
  appropriate. Commandline options --job and --cron renamed as well
  to --jobgroup and --runjobs.

* Have NonTaxableField check all ProductFiles tables for the field if
  needed, instead of just the one in mv_ib or the first ProductFiles
  table. This allows NonTaxableField to work with options when the base
  product has a nontaxable field, but the options table has no nontaxable
  field (as in Foundation). This should have no effect on people using
  NonTaxableField the standard way.

* Add option to product_common and item_common that allows an empty
  field to be returned. In effect this option means "give me the value
  of this field from the first ProductFiles table that has the field
  at all" instead of "give me the first non-empty value from a ProductFiles
  table that has the field".

* Optimize item_common a bit by looking at each table only once.

* Allow systems with broken locks to not destroy the pidfile lock
  by reading the file. Alleviates inability to use "interchange -stop".
  Requires setting

	Variable MV_BAD_LOCK 1

  in interchange.cfg.

  Thanks to Daniel Hutchinson for finding the problem!

* Add no_requery option to Vend::Table::DBI::query method to ensure that
  SQL::Statement will not be called. Use it when you are sure your table is
  in the database referenced....avoids errors on multiple key inserts that
  might return undef.

* Fixed the row_count (0E0) problem in Vend::Table::DBI.

* Compile errors on ActionMap/FormAction are passed through now.

* Use fix base directory for global jobs.

* Let Vend::Util::unhexify mangle only representations of hex chars instead
  of any three-letter-string starting with the percent sign.

* Add database filename in question to the fatal error in the
  Vend::Table::Common::column_index method.

* Fix auto_create_dir option in Vend::Util:writefile which didn't work.

* Fix round_to_frac_digits() so it handles numbers that don't have a
  pre-existing decimal point.

* Prevent internal server error if quantity pricing row cannot be found
  for whatever reason.

* Add Australian BankCard to Vend::Order::guess_cc_type 
  (contributed by Howard Lowndes).

* Make aliased UserTag respect EndTag setting.

* Vend::Util::string_to_ref no longer looks at $Vend::Cfg->{ExtraSecure},
  which really contradicts the documentation.

* Allow $Session->{mv_order_number} to be set anywhere.

* Allow multiple start points for a tree query.

* Prevent NOT NULL errors for data that is actually supposed to be defined
  during a data update.

* Add container values for config files.

	<Variable FOOBAR>
		Something in the FOOBAR variable.
	</Variable>

  This is exactly equivalent to:

  	Variable FOOBAR <<EOV
		Something in the FOOBAR variable.
	EOV

   except that the end marker can have leading/trailing whitespace
   and capitalization is not important.

* Allows trigger response to end container; currently only "yesno"
  directives are defined. The "yesno" behavior allows:

  <ParseVariables Yes>
  	Static __CATALOG_STATIC__
  	StaticLogged __LOGGED_STATIC__
  </ParseVariables>

  This will set ParseVariables to Yes

* Directives of the same type cannot be nested (though I might do that
  shortly). Directives of different types can be nested, so you can
  do:

  	<ParseVariables Yes>
		<Route log>
			foo   __BAR__
		</route>
	</Parsevariables>

  (Note that capitalization doesn't matter.)

* You can add triggers for directives by setting the ContainerSpecial
  variable in package Vend::Config. This would allow:

  	 <DirectiveUniverse foo>
	 	Foobar   yes
	 </DirectiveUnivers>

  	 <DirectiveUniverse bar>
	 	Foobar   yes
	 </DirectiveUnivers>

  Perhaps more importantly, it might allow:

  <Catalog found /var/lib/interchange/found /c/found>
  	  Variable  INITTED   This catalog has an initted value already.
  </catalog>

  Note that this is not yet implemented!

* Update pgp_encrypt to accept multiple encryption keys.  Keys should be
  passed as a space or comma separated list.

* Change behavior of UserDB _check_acl routine so that undefined value
  is returned if location is not present at all. This allows a check
  both on the file location and the parent directory location without
  affecting true/false status.

* Fix LENGTH_EXCEPTION_DEFAULT logging, which did not work and clean up
  the code a bit in DBI module.

* Remove attempt to unimport Config (to save a small amount of memory)
  because it causes Perl 5.6.0 to die.

* Allow setting of table type in MySQL (or others if HAS_TABLE_TYPE
  is put in capabilities). This allows setting the table type to
  something besides the default -- in particular allows InnoDB type
  setting for userdb/transactions/orderline.

* Patch slight security hole where user password can be saved in session.

* Keep copy of CGI values at time of history save, not reference to them
  (which can be changed in subsequent code).

* Make mv_return_fields available to iterate_array_list.

* Change processing of [PREFIX-line] to use that value instead of
  rebuilding from scratch.

* Make multi-output play nice with download via [deliver ...].

File
----

* Add new Vend::File module with minimal functions, changed UserTags
  to support it.

* Relocate following routines (and their subsidiaries) from Vend::Util:

	canonpath
	catdir
	catfile
	exists_filename
	file_modification_time
	file_name_is_absolute
	get_filename
	lockfile
	path
	readfile
	readfile_db
	set_lock_type
	unlockfile
	writefile

  Added stubs so that package-based calls to those routines will not
  break software.

* Added CatalogUser directive that allows setting in interchange.cfg
  of allowed username that is used for access to absolute-path names.

  	CatalogUser  foundation  joe
  	CatalogUser  reports     jane

  This sets the user for allowed_file() for further read/write checks
  based on username.

* Created allowed_file() routine and replaced all current inline checks
  for NoAbsolute with call to that routine. It behaves as:

  NoAbsolute is No: all files are accessible, always

  Allowed for read/write:
  	Path name is relative with no ..
  	Path name is absolute but in the catalog directory
  	Path name is absolute but in a TemplateDir

  Allowed for read:
	CatalogUser set to a valid username and file is readable by that user
	CatalogUser set to a valid username and file is readable by a group
	 containing that user

  Allowed for write:
	CatalogUser set to a valid username and file is writable by that user
	CatalogUser set to a valid username and file is writable by a group
	 containing that user

* Changed display_special_page so that special page entries with ../
  will not break things.

* Created $Vend::File::errstr which is set to get the error message,
  otherwise defaults to the standard one.

* Add both global- and catalog-level FileControl directive that allows
  mapping subroutines (or named pre-existing subroutines) to a path.
  Does a depth-first search starting with the file name.

* In either interchange.cfg (takes priority) or catalog.cfg put:

	FileControl include/junk  <<EOR
	sub {
		my ($fn, $checkpath, $write, @caller) = @_;

		## Allow write to files containing "foo"
		if($write) {
			return $fn =~ /foo/;
		}

		## Allow read if file doesn't contain "bar"
		return $fn !~ /bar/;
	}
	EOR

* In either interchange.cfg (takes priority) or catalog.cfg put:

	FileControl  include/junk  some_sub

  This uses either Sub or GlobalSub

* Only in interchange.cfg, you can put a mapped routine name:

	FileControl  include/junk  Vend::SomeModule::file_control

* Intrinsic FileControl checks.

	# Is a catalog superuser
    FileControl foo/bar ic_super

	# Is a catalog admin
	FileControl foo/bar ic_admin

	# Is logged in at all
	FileControl foo/bar ic_logged

	# Is logged in at userdb table of "userdb"
	FileControl foo/bar ic_logged:userdb

	# Is logged in at userdb table of "affiliate"
	FileControl foo/bar ic_logged:affiliate

	# Run check on userdb file_acl
	FileControl foo/bar ic_userdb

	# Run check on userdb file_acl
	FileControl foo/bar ic_userdb:file_acl

	# Run check on userdb db_acl
	FileControl foo/bar ic_userdb:db_acl

	# Check for $Scratch->{dealer} set
    FileControl foo/bar ic_scratch:dealer

	# Check for $Scratch->{dealer} NOT set
    FileControl foo/bar ic_scratch_deny:dealer

	# Check for $Session->{secure} set
    FileControl foo/bar ic_session:secure

	# Check for $Session->{secure} NOT set
    FileControl foo/bar ic_session_deny:secure

  These don't override the NoAbsolute checks.

* If no FileControl is not set, the checks are not done for performance
  reasons.

Options
-------

* Major update to product options.

* Options are now modular in much the same way as Vend::Payment is.
  You can add an unlimited number of option types simply by dropping
  a module into Vend::Options.

* By default, the old 4.8 style options are in force, implemented
  with Vend::Options::Old48.

  If you add this to catalog.cfg (in etc/after.cfg in foundation):

  	OptionsEnable   option_type

  The "option_type" names a field in the products file which controls
  the option type. This enables new-style options.

  It can also be in a specific table and field, ala AutoModifier:

  	OptionsEnable   table:field

  Indeed, this is added to AutoModifer after catalog.cfg.

* There are two new-style options included:

	Vend::Options::Matrix
	Vend::Options::Simple

  These are equivalent to the current matrix and simple options.

* Options behavior is controlled in catalog.cfg by a locale-style
  multiple hash (ala UserDb or Route):

  	Options   Matrix   sort            o_sort,o_group
  	Options   Matrix   variant_table   my_variants

* To find and add a new option type, simply set something in
  catalog.cfg:

  	Options  MyOptions  table  my_options

  That will cause a require of Vend::Options::MyOptions.

* The matrix products have been moved to the "variants" table.

* The options table contains options for both Matrix and Simple types,
  but only fields for building those simple-type options (which are
  used to generate variants for Matrix). The following fields
  have been removed from options:

	differential
	mv_shipmode
	o_enable
	o_exclude
	o_footer
	o_header
	o_include
	o_master
	o_matrix
	o_modular
	phantom
	volume
	weight

* The variants table is a subset of the fields in products.

* The admin page for each option style is defined in its
  admin_page routine, usually an include from inclued/Options/OptionType.

* Size and color fields removed from products table, option_type added.

Menu
----

* Add category-specific image links and toggles for the tree menu.

  To enable this for toggles, do:

  	  [menu
	  		menu-type=tree
			...
			specific-image-toggle=N
			]

  Where N is the level (1 == 0) to which you wish to do this.

  The image for a non-toggled category comes from the tree database field
  img_up, for a toggled category from img_dn.

  You can set the base URL for the images with:

  		specific-image-base="__IMAGE_DIR__";

  A trailing / is added if not already present.

  If you wish to allow image anchors for links as well, put the image
  name in the img_up field and add the parameter:

  	       specific-image-link=1

  If the image name is not present, the normal "name" field is used.

  To enable all of this for the example product_tree component, you would
  have a call of:

	[menu tree-selector="[control tree_selector Products]"
			link-class="[control link_class barlink]"
			link-style="[control link_style]"
			link-class-open="[control link_class_open]"
			link-style-open="[control link_style_open font-size: larger;]"
			link-class-closed="[control link_class_closed]"
			link-style-closed="[control link_style_closed font-size: larger;]"
			no-image="[control no_image]"
			menu-type=tree
			specific-image-toggle=1
			specific-image-base="__IMAGE_DIR__/tree"
			specific-image-link=1
			reparse=0]

* Add ability to load tree-based menus where items inhabit more than
  one category. To wit:

    code    sku       prod_group        category
    1       os28003   Tools             Brushes
    2       os28003   Painting Supplies Brushes

  The tree will allow search and find of these items in more than
  one category.

* Add "items" check to menu to allow showing an entry only if items are
  in the cart. Works for current cart ($Vend::Items) only.

* Optimization for tree-based menus, allow reliable build with
  [timed-build]. Example:

	[timed-build file=tmp/the_tree minutes=10 force=1]
	[menu	name=the_tree
			menu-type=tree
			js-prefix=the_tree_
			timed=1
	][/menu]
	[/timed-build]
	[menu open-script=1 js-prefix="the_tree_"/]

  This allows the tree to retain its opened status without having to
  build a different timed-build file for every combination.

  Now tree and flyout menus should be easily usable in a catalog without
  worrying about processor power.

* Add configurability for the open/collapse/explode variable. Before this,
  you could only have one tree per page and have it keep the open status. Now:

  	[menu name=foo menu-type=tree js_prefix=foo open_variable=foo_open][/menu]

  	[menu name=bar menu-type=tree js_prefix=bar open_variable=bar_open][/menu]

  will work for the appropriate menu. (The other will collapse.)

* Don't add .html extension if file already has extension.

Form
----

* Fix "double March" bug in date widget.

* Allow templated options in select, radio, checkbox, etc. Enabled
  by passing option_template="ATTR Template".

  Uses same attr_list methodology as in most IC secondary templating.

  Active keys:

  	  LABEL           The normal label value
  	  VALUE           The normal value
	  PRICE           The formatted price, converted for locale
	  PRICE_NOFORMAT  The raw price data
	  ABSOLUTE        The formatted price, absolute (no negative)
	  NEGATIVE        Set true if price data is negative

  The default is equivalent to (though it doesn't use formatting):

  		{LABEL} {PRICE?}({PRICE}){/PRICE?}

  This example:

	{LABEL}
		{PRICE?}
			{NEGATIVE?}(subtract {ABSOLUTE}){/NEGATIVE?}
			{NEGATIVE:}(add {PRICE}){/NEGATIVE:}
		{/PRICE?}

	Would turn:

		Ebony handle ($20.00)
		Wood handle
		Plastic handle ($-5.00)

    into:

		Ebony handle (add $20.00)
		Wood handle
		Plastic handle (subtract $5.00)

* Add widget "filetext" to allow direct upload of a file to a database
  field. Useful for content/article bodies that you want to edit in a
  file but that are inconvenient to clip-past into a textarea.

  The "filetext" widget is an <input type=file> followed
  by a textarea. It shows the contents of the field in the textarea
  and you can edit it. If you want to replace it with a file upload,
  you just Browse to the file and upload it; it negates what is in
  the textarea. If no file is uploaded, the textarea pertains (I guess
  that statement is redundant).

  The type=filetext widget should always be used in combination with two
  filters, "nullselect upload".

* Remove extra closing HTML tag '>' character from password widget.

* Allow table conglomerations of checkboxes and radio boxes with more
  than 9 columns (i.e. radio_right_10). Thanks to Bill Carr for finding.

* Allow multiple semi-colon-separated queries to populate options via
  lookup_query.

* Added a =None to the file list of the imagedir widget so one has
  the opportunity to choose an 'empty' value if no input is required.

Editor
------

* Allow override of checking for incomplete forms.

* Get rid of excess space which causes "unparsed and temporary" page
  controls to fail.

UI
--

* Fix dependency of page editor on certain [if ...] conditions in page code.

* Add "send help edit to ICDEVGROUP" function in the online help editor.

* Change name of "Bottom" menu (which was on top) to "Fixed". 

* Check for SQL::Statement version (with hooks for testing any version,
  lower or higher) at admin index load time, and provide warning that
  things won't work properly.

* Allow multiple help window destinations.

* Remove preferred payment method from customer view and change primitive
  used to display username.

* Fix "admin/bg.gif not found" error.

* Allow pass of nodelete and mv_auto_export options in URL.

* Add "Decrypt Credit Card" back in order view.

* Add mv_more_alpha and mv_more_decade options to flex_selector. Make
  locale and country tables use them by default.

* Fix link_rows_blank setting in table editor for form linking.

* Restore capability to show only part of session.

* Solve annoying problem where you edit a view-specific field display
  and have to re-enter custom view information that is already
  present in a modified base meta display.

* Add check for existence of the extended/default columns
  and display of merge errors to merge_meta page.

* Add Levies to the 'show only' list of the show_session page.

* Use sane default while merging metadata to avoid breakage of perl code 
  if no ui-version record exists.

* Allow the "Next order" button in the admin order_view to jump over a few
  (20, by default) missing order numbers in the order sequence so that
  deleted order numbers here and there don't throw the user back to the
  order list view. Maximum number to skip settable by variable
  UI_ORDER_VIEWNEXT_MAX_SKIP, now in Foundation "Admin control" section.

* Add option to replace all occurences to Search & Replace page.

* Make spreadsheet search not word-boundary dependent.

* Allow exclusion of fields for database imports.

* Fixed typo in file_navigator tag.

* Fix extra parameter passing in wizard.

* Display size, color and options on "Order view" page again.

* Fix Query-By-Example forms for LARGE tables.

* Remove hard-coded "Pending" status and put real info on "Order view" page.

* More metadata tools. New tag [meta-info table=foo col=bar key=label] returns
  "label" metadata item. Can access any key in meta record including extended.
  Has localize=1 flag to localize returned labels.

  Small example of how to use this in pages/admin/customer.html -- allows
  you to change "Company" to "Affilation" or "Organization" and have a hope
  of having it show up everywhere.

* Continued preparation for translation.

* Fix HTML problem in order entry page found by 
  Nicholas Cook <ncook@foxmillpets.com>.

* Add "Download slice" functionality to table export page. Allows you to
  select arbitrary columns to directly download.

* Add ability to download TAB-delimited results of an arbitrary SQL
  query. You can do:

		SELECT   sku, count(code) as times_ordered, sum(quantity) as qty
		FROM     orderline
		GROUP BY sku

  and get downloaded to a file:

			sku                 times_ordered       total
			0738417912          1                   2
			0972355901          1                   1

			V4081300498         1                   1

* Add shipmethod to display in order_view page, make some display 
  fields conditional.

* Fix bug in address display in customer_view page.

* Message for free shipping added to entry page.

Payment
-------

* Add support for Verisign's PFProAPI.pm Perl module, which implements
  Payflow Pro gateway communication without needing any external binary,
  and thus no forking or temporary files for communication. Use PFProAPI
  automatically if it is found at IC startup time, but fall back to pfpro
  or pfpro-file if not. Upgrades should be transparent.

* Add COMMENT1 and COMMENT2 to Verisign queries. These map to values
  comment1 and comment2 by default in Payment.pm, but can be remapped.

  Also put SHIPTOZIP in the varmap for simplicity, but same function.

* Minor data filtering modifications to BoA module.

* Map company and b_company for payment use.

* Authorize.Net:
  
  - Send to Authorize.Net customer shipping address information and company
    where available.

  - Add Card Security Code (AKA CVV2, CVC2, CSC, CID) verification support
    (uses Authorize.Net protocol version 3.1). (Chaim Klar <c_klar@c-cs.com>).

  - Added the whole list of response codes (Chaim Klar <c_klar@c-cs.com>).

* Add new Verisign route parameter, "check_sub", which allows a Sub or
  GlobalSub to be called after a successful charge for a check of some
  sort. 

Shipping
--------

* Allow redirection of shipping modes.

  Basically, you can do:

  upsg_or_free	UPS Ground	[subtotal noformat=1]	0	99.99	>>upsg
  upsg_or_free	UPS Ground	price	100	99999	0		{ free => 'Free!' }

  upsg	UPS Ground	weight	0	150	u Ground

  The first mode redirects to the second one if the order total is
  less that $100; if it is more, it gives free shipping.

  Add [shipping widget="Vend::Form widget" mode="mode1 mode2"] to
  automatically build widget with Vend::Form. Works just like
  [shipping label=1 ...] but produces a complete widget.

* Support Canadian and 2003 US UPS Zone files.

* Add mv_ship_residential with automatic lookup of residential charge in
  properly formatted rate tables.

  Requires residential => 1 option in shipping definition.

* Add EAS surcharge via different means than EAS capability. Allows lookup
  of exception zip codes in surcharge_table => 'tablename' option.
  surcharge_field => 'fieldname' defaults to "surcharge".

* Allow aggregation of weights over a number of pounds.

  If aggregate => 1, that is 150 pounds. Breaks it up into 150-pound
  packages and then a final package at the remainder.

  If aggregate > 10, breaks it up into that many pound packages.

* Break out shipping stuff from Vend::Interpolate. Add stubs so
  custom code doesn't break.

* Add ability to put custom shipping modules in, called with
  "cost" field of "s Module".

* Improve [ups-query ...] to aggregate shipments and cache prior
  lookups.

* Document [ups-query].

* Add some tweezy scripts that help make US Postal zone charts and
  tables. Use at your own risk.

Levies
------

* Fix bugs preventing the usage of the customer defined routine and
  calling it with the wrong parameters.

* New Levy add_to key allows consolidation of levies under one
  heading.

	Levies  salestax  foo

	Levy    salestax    description    "Sales Tax (%s)"
	Levy    salestax    keep_if_zero   1
	Levy    salestax    type           salestax
	Levy    salestax    sort           002
	Levy    salestax    label_value    state

	Levy    foo    keep_if_zero   0
	Levy    foo    add_to         salestax
	Levy    foo    type           shipping
	Levy    foo    mode           PERD

  This will calculate the foo levy, but add its cost to the salestax
  levy for display purposes.

* Remove sprintf() function and replace with round_to_frac_digits,
  prevent worries about rounding errors.

* Allow label_value for all levy types, means you can do
  something like:

	Levy    shipping    description       Shipping (%s)
	Levy    shipping    keep_if_zero      0
	Levy    shipping    type              shipping
	Levy    shipping    mode_from_values  mv_shipmode
	Levy    shipping    label_value       zip

  which will display

    Shipping (45056)

i18n
----

* Add alias [L] => [loc] in order to resolve [L] tags in variables
  independent of the configuration.

* Localize script now groks new menu database files.

* Add Italian UI translation from Marco Mescoli <m.mescoli@omnibit.nu>.

Foundation
----------

* Support for SQLite added.

* Make metadata correspond to current UI version.

* Fix orderline import deficiency in etc/log_entry found by Karen Gold
  (KarenG@LOADUP.com). 

* Change [discount-price] to [item-discount-price] to make it compatible
  with editor components.

* Preparation of pages for translation.

* Typo in state database fixed (Bugzilla #499).

* Modified include_form code on General Tab of item_edit page
  in such a way that item images and thumb images with
  extensions other that .gif can be displayed as well.

  Replaced <img ...> by:
	[image 	src="[var IMAGE_DIR]/items/[cgi item_id]" extra="border=0 id=item_img"]

* Remove straggling Red Hat/IC logo and URLs, update foundation logos to match
  Interchange 4.8's latest.

* Added ALT attribute to Home links.

* All of the order profiles had common information. Made a
  Variable called COMMON_ORDER_PROFILE to hold that info
  to remove duplication.

* Add proper autonumber initialization to affiliate database so
  it will generate affiliate codes that are valid. Thanks to
  Kevin Old for reporting.

* Use LENGTH_EXCEPTION_DEFAULT for Postgres userdb, transactions,
  orderline tables in foundation.

* Remove unused ship address pages and unused large gift certificate image.

* Use the common placeholder for the email address in survey database.

* Set more reasonable default types for each SQL DB.

* Use mv_form_profile instead of mv_order_profile on account page in
  order to check user's input.

Debian
------

* Default traffic setting is low now.

* Allow selection of traffic setting with debconf and interchangeconfig.

* Specify unix and inet modes explicitly if user selects both. 

* Check if /etc/init.d/interchange and /usr/sbin/interchangeconfig are 
  executable in interchange-ui maintainer scripts.

* UPGRADE and README.cvs added to interchange.docs
  
* avoid installation error by checking installation state before
  invoking interchange --add/--remove from interchange-cat-foundation
  postinst script (thanks to Doug Alcorn <doug@lathi.net> for reporting
  the problem)

* remove configuration files handled by interchangeconfig on purge

* protect against scripts ending up in /usr/lib/interchange

* get_url UserTag forces dependency on libwww-perl

UserTags
--------

* history-scan - Added new option called 'pageonly' that causes history-scan 
  to return only the name of the previous page rather than a full "area" link.
  Can be used to set mv_successpage for a form.

* Removed some code that caused table-organize to write the td.x attributes
  twice. 

* find - New usertag in spirit of the Unix command with the same name.

* Add [button wait-text="-- Please Wait --" text="Place Order" ...] so
  button has indication of press beyond normal browser indication.

  Allow direct setting of id, class, and style HTML characteristics without
  having to shoehorn them in extra=" style='...'" etc.

* Fix typo in auto-wizard UserTag so it works with ITL conditionals.

* weight  - New usertag to set and determine shipping weight easily.

Filters
-------

* Add "upload" filter. Checks to see if the submitted variable
  is a file upload, if it is it reads the file and places it in
  $CGI->{$varname}. Otherwise uses the value of the variable.

* Add "line" filter which rips off the first line of a longer text.

* Change "date_change" field in order to handle MySQL DATE resp.
  DATETIME fields.

Jobs
----

* update_locales job added.

* Remove bogus session created by logging function.

SOAP
----

* Ensure that SOAP server adds a blank line between HTTP header
  and HTTP body.

* Log errors in soap tag to catalog log file instead of the global one.

* SOAP_Action introduced, which is intended to used as a
  way to provide webservices from an Interchange catalog.

* Allow tracing in SOAP calls in order to get a handle on SOAP request
  resp. response.

* Error handling revised.

* Add SOAP_Control configuration directive and soap_gate access
  check routine to control requests to the SOAP server.

* Change to the catalog directory so that log messages end up
  in the correct file etc.

Shadow Database
---------------

* Add stub for sort_each method.

* column_exists method calls now method of underlying class instead of a
  lookup in the database structure which didn't work properly

* each_nokey is now properly replacing the shadowed fields.

* Moved configuration code to the module itself.

* Add name method.

* Map autonumber method to Vend::Table::Common.

* Introduce mv_shadowpass scratch variable which instructs
  the Shadow database code to return the original database record.

* Add stub for inc_field method.

* Add stub for delete_record method.

* Non-select queries are passed to underlying database immediately.

* Fix queries with list type.

* Fix errmsg calls.

Static Page Generation
----------------------

* Remove this feature completely from Interchange:

  -- remove configuration directives ClearCache (not in use),
     StaticIndex, StaticSessionDefault, StaticTrack (introduced in 4.9.x)
  -- deprecate configuration directives NoCache, Static, StaticAll,
     StaticDBM, StaticDepth, StaticFly, StaticLogged, StaticPage,
     StaticPath, StaticPattern, StaticSuffix
  -- remove UI tag regenerate
  -- remove InvalidateCache attribute from distributed usertags
  -- remove build flag from [tag] usertag
  -- remove UI pages (regen and regenerate)
  -- remove support from foundation and test catalog
  -- remove path_adjust Pragma which is only useful in conjunction with
     StaticPath configuration directive
  -- remove Vend::Interpolate::cache_html, Vend::Interpolate::resolve_static, 
     Vend::Interpolate::static_url and Vend::Session::tie_static_dbm routines
  -- remove variables $Vend::AccumulatingLinks, @Vend::Links, 
     %Vend::LinkFound, $Vend::ForceBuild, $Vend::CachePage.
  
Miscellaneous
-------------

* Fix a bug that prevented the cgi-bin link program from being associated 
  with the chosen owner and group. The patch was created and tested by Carl
  Bailey.
  
Extensions
----------

* Quickbooks updates:

  - Documentation built from updated Interchange + Quickbooks HOWTO.

  - Major change to IIF generation routine:
    - IIF files are generated on-demand via the Admin UI
	- In-route method still available
	- New "Generate new IIF files" and "download IIF files"
	
  - New "qb_safe" filter, to cater to Quickbooks sensative side.
  
  - New default values (like defaulting to cash receipt instead of invoice)
  
  - Payment and Shipping methods are recorded in corresponding Quickbooks fields.
  
  - Allow customization of the transaction account (new default is "Checking")
  
  - Optionally set the transaction class (e.g., to track online sales in a
    separate class from walk-in sales, and report on them differently). 
  
  - Optional Item Prefixes (e.g. if all items are accounting in Quickbooks under
    a given category.
	
  - Optionally get the tax agency from the "state" table, falling back to the
    configured default tax agency.
 
  - Bug fixes


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 4.9.7 released only via nightly builds.

  
------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 4.9.6 released 2003-01-08.


Core
----

* Perl version 5.6.0 or newer is now a requirement to run Interchange.

* Add new global directive TrustProxy, which allows the administrator to
  designate certain IP addresses or hostnames as trusted proxies, whose
  claims (via the HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR environment variable) about the
  original requesting host will be believed.

  When using a front-end proxy for Interchange, all requests appear to come
  from that proxy, say 127.0.0.1 if on the same machine, which is effectively
  the same as running WideOpen because sessions can be easily hijacked. This
  offers a way to bring back a little discernment about what host we're
  really dealing with.

  Usage is identical to the RobotIP directive's, for example:

  TrustProxy 127.0.0.1, 10.0.0.*

  I'm not sure why anyone would want to do this, but it could also be used
  with external HTTP proxies in general (which hopefully aren't lying), with
  a simple 'TrustProxy *'.

* Fix whitespace transform and tolerate leading whitespace on HTTP
  header lines.

* Avoid persistent storage to make [summary] safe in prefork mode.

* Allow a database to spring into existence without a .txt file. TO
  do this, you define the field names in the NAME paramter.

      Database will_be_there  will_be_there.txt  __SQLDSN__
      Database will_be_there  NAME   code  field1 field2
      Database will_be_there  CREATE_EMPTY_TXT  1

  All it does is create the .txt file (or whatever the name is) from
  the value of NAME array. It does take delimiters into account.

  You must be just a bit careful, since if you then remove the .txt
  file it will of course recreate the table. Of course you should
  take that into account when setting this non-default parameter.

  This will allow some one-file configurations to be added to the
  system.

* Allow autonumber for the linked-table behavior of update_data. Before,
  you couldn't autonumber because the determination of whether the data
  would be set was whether the key value is present. This allows
  you to set mv_data_qual=fieldname and have a non-empty value in
  that field determine whether to insert or not.

* Minor cleanup in Data.pm, including ensuring $obj->{DELIMITER} 
  and $obj->{delimiter} match.

* Avoid infinite loops in catalog configuration caused by includes.

* Compile warnings in catalog usertags now show up in the logs instead
  of "UserTag 'ugly_hack' code is not a subroutine reference".

* Add new database configuration option PREFER_NULL. It accepts a list of
  field names which should be set to NULL instead of an empty string
  whenever possible:

  Database  people  PREFER_NULL  age height

  Probably most useful with numeric or date fields that are nullable, to
  prevent import errors when trying to store '' into a numeric field. Also
  for character fields that you'd rather have contain a NULL than '' to
  comply with a CHECK or foreign key constraint.

UserTags
--------

* Obsolete usertags dbinfo, e, if-key-exists, if_sql, reconfig_wait, 
  rotate_file, with and write_page removed.

Filters
-------

* Allow % in filter arguments. This could conceivably be a problem for
  someone who had a filter ".%s" or something.

Content Management
------------------

* Get restrict_allow settings right -- the default was not allowing the "var"
  to be expanded in the image preview path. Should probably look at this
  concept on a per-field basis, and set the default to "".

Payment
-------

* Patch to display errors from payment modules in credit card header
  on checkout page.

Foundation
----------

* Multi-language support, configured by the LOCALES and DEFAULTLOCALE
  variables.

* Updated region templates.

* New PayflowPro control variables MV_PAYMENT_PARTNER and MV_PAYMENT_VENDOR.

* Payment routes use now generic MV_PAYMENT_* variables.

* Test order page added.

Shadow Database
---------------

* lookup_table option added

* foreign method implemented

* test_record calls underlying database now

Installation
------------

* Debian packages support the selection of the GnuPG home directory 
  during installation now.

mod_interchange
---------------

* Fixed a weird bug where empty HTTP variables were being passed
  under certain circumstances.

* Fixed a bug reported by Jeff Dafoe.  The request information
  enabled Interchange to show the correct page but prevented it
  from storing the request in the session's history.  The problem
  only showed itself when Interchange's [history-scan] tag was used.
  As almost no page history was saved, [history-scan] sent the user
  to the default page (usually index) most of the time. 


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 4.9.5 released 2002-12-13 (minor bugfix release).


Foundation
----------

* Add component files for new selectable results-list done by Ton.

* Make proper patches to history-scan and barlink() to work with Randy
  Moore's category_vert_toggle component.

* Minor updates to category_vert_toggle component for HTML cleanup and 
  performance improvement.

Core
----

* Fixed problem with PreFork and mod_perl modes where Interchange children
  kept order profile state between runs.

* Make sure STDERR is selected in mod_perl mode in case some other mod_perl 
  code uses select. 

* Change default for MaxServers in "rpc" profile to zero. This is probably
  best for the vast majority of servers running in PreFork mode.

* Tolerate missing configdb database, issue warning only.

* Tolerate people forgetting and putting , on the end of a parameter
  when using line2options. A comma should never be the last character, I
  would think, but you can choose to not use the filter if by some
  bizarre chance it is needed.

* A number of refinements and fixes to Menu module.

	- Passing timed=1 to [menu ...] tag prevents putting session ID and
	  count in URL, allowing timed-build to work well.

	- first_line and last_line transforms allow you to specify a field
	  to set to trigger the first line or the last line of the menu.
	  This allows the current IC menu structures to work well with
	  menus separated by space.

	- logical_page feature allows a tab "up" indication in another
	  menu, based on the page of the entry. This allows multi-level
	  tabs to have an "up" indication on different menus.

	- expand_values_form allows setting of ITL tag values even
	  on multiple form values.  Honors [cgi ..], [value ..], and [var ..].

    - Fix ordering of open parameter for trees -- it was broken by the new
	  Vend::Util::vendUrl routine.

* Simplify field_settor subroutines with prepared query and placeholders.
  Prevents infamous DBD::Pg::do errors.

* Form module -- add intrinsic "file" type, and allow setting of a
  widget class directly without using "extra".

* Other minor bugfixes too insignificant to mention.

UserTags
--------

* min-rows option added to table-organize tag. Allows building small
  result sets in one column (or however many columns needed to reach
  min-rows).

* Reworked [tree ...] tag to use DBI placeholders if supported.
  While this doesn't seem to save too much CPU on a machine that
  has the database and IC on the same machine, it should relieve
  some network bandwidth on distributed setups.

Installation
------------

* Various debian build patches.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 4.9.4 released 2002-12-02.

* Fix problem with PreFork and mod_perl modes where Interchange children
  kept order profile state between runs.

* Tolerate people forgetting and putting , on the end of a parameter
  when using line2options.

Core
----

* The interchange script is now only used for configuration and
  options. All code that previously resided there (notably the
  dispatch(), respond(), update_data(), and do_order() routines)
  has been relocated. Code that calls ::update_data, etc. should
  NOT break, because we still use the modules in the script.
  This caused the addition of Vend::Dispatch to hold many of
  the routines.

* Added new [deliver ....] tag that allows you to deliver some content
  without worrying about [tag op=header] and page spacing issues. Adds 
  new global variable $Vend::Sent which is authoritative notification
  that all content is sent and that all further parsing of ITL
  should stop.

* Add mv_source parameter which sets an affiliate program source
  and can be carried around in URLs when $Scratch->{mv_add_source}
  is set. This solves the problem of AOL caching the page with
  the source embedded, then forwarding the next request sans source.

  From a suggestion by Dan <ic@concolor.org>.

* Add new [menu ...] tag which can build simple, tree, and flyout
  menus from a menu specification. See the UI.

* Add robot tolerance facility, where mv_tmp_session is set when either
  a RobotUA, RobotIP or RobotHost wildcard matches.

  In interchange.cfg:

      RobotUA   Inktomi, Scooter, Site*Sucker
      RobotIP   209.135.65, 64.172.5.*
      RobotHost *.googlebot.com

  After that, it is all automatic. mv_tmp_session gets set to one, the
  Scratch values mv_no_session_id and mv_no_count are set to one, and
  normal pages don't get IDs put out by area.

  What this will do for the user:

        1. Allow those UAs to follow a URL.
        2. Prevent useless session files from cluttering disk
        3. Prevent session writes from inhibiting disk performance.

* Added a (global) HostnameLookups directive to specify whether Interchange
  should perform a DNS lookup to resolve the remote user's hostname from
  their IP address.  The default is 'No'.  Hostnames are required for
  facilities such as the RobotHost check to work.  If the web server is
  configured to perform hostname resolution then this directive should remain
  set to 'No'.

* Add the oft-requested DirectoryIndex feature. 

* Add new content management features. This allows Interchange to:

    -- Accept Apache error redirects, i.e. handle 404 errors
    -- Initially process page, process page after variables, and
       process page before image substitution with configurable subroutines
    -- Take puts for DAV-style publishing

*   New "AcceptRedirect" directive. If "Yes", will look for REDIRECT_URL,
    REDIRECT_QUERY_STRING, etc. and use those to provide the request.

    This allows:

        ErrorDocument 404 /cgi-bin/foundation

    At that point, a request for /index.html that is not found will
    be equivalent to /cgi-bin/foundation/index.html and will be
    indistinguishable from the real page by the client.

*   New Pragmas init_page, pre_page, post_page, which specify
    Sub/GlobalSub routines to run at various points in page build.

    init_page     Run before Variable substitution
    pre_page      Run after Variable substitution, before interpolation
    post_page     Run before Image substitution

* Allow PUT operations. Add

    [value-extended test=isput]       Check for a PUT
    [value-extended put_contents=1]   Return PUT string
    [value-extended put_ref=1]        Return ref to PUT string (scalar)

  Some more DAV-type features can be done, I think, but they are not yet
  scoped.

* Remove min_string test from Search.pm, where it never really was used
  or called due to mv_min_string default being 0.

* Place mv_min_string check back in Glimpse where it was intended in the first
  place.

* Convert Mac line endings to Unix (as well as DOS).

* Finally discovered what is going on with GPG and errors.

  -- If PGP fails due to a system problem, like out of memory or
     bad file permissions, it fails with a status that will cause
     a real error which is in the lower 8 bits.

  -- If PGP fails due to an internal problem like "key not found",
     or no secret key ring, it will fail with system status set to
     zero but the upper level status indicating its problem.

     So a failed key will turn up as "File not found" in the
     upper order bits, while a key *ring* not found will fail
     with the same error in the lower status bits.

  This patch is temporary, and at least tells you what $! is. I will
  examine GPG's error messages and provide some simple ones like "key
  not on keyring" and catch them to provide a better error.

* Add general multiple-table update feature to Vend::Data::update_data.

* Allow authoritative table name for constructed queries. Usage:

    my $db = database_exists_ref($table);
    my $tname = $db->name();

    my $query = "select * from $tname";
    $db->query($query);

  This should allow REAL_NAME many more places.

* New mv_cleanup operates like mv_click and mv_check, but operates
  after a form processing action is done.

* Added debug type to [log].

* [userdb function=logout clear=1] will now restore the appropriate
  ScratchDefault and ValuesDefault values instead of simply
  deleting the scratches and values under its control.

* Added check for no_increment so that mv_order_number can be set in
  a route.

* Fix bug where bad [nitems compare=...] could cause server error. Now
  just silently causes bad compare.

* Allow alternate values spaces with $CGI->{mv_values_space}. This allows
  fill-in wizards, surveys, and such to not pollute the user's normal
  values.

  Use with caution -- if someone is in the practice of using $Values
  to set catalog behavior (usually a poor idea) then it can cause
  anomalies.

* Clean up a few references to $Vend::Session->{values} which should
  never be done anymore -- we had handled almost all of this previously.
  It should always reference $::Values.

Installation
------------

* "you are now ready to run makecat" is no longer displayed on upgrades.

* Prevent test from failing on upgrades.

Payment
-------

* Patch from Mark Johnson to Vend::Payment::Signio module whose explanation
  we quote: 
  If you send a garbage ORIGID, as IC does by default, it will attempt to
  use that as the key for the transaction, without falling back on the data
  you sent with it. Thus, it must explicitly not be used unless you have a
  valid one which you want to use. This was why no credits were succeeding;
  even though we were sending explicit new data, it ignored it and cried 
  with the ever useful error "Not signed up for this tender type".

* Added a Vend::Payment::TestPayment module to allow developers to test
  their site's interaction with the Interchange Payment system, without
  actually being connected to a real Payment Services Provider. 

* Change AuthorizeNet.pm to more easily enable settlement of orders
  done via AUTH_ONLY.

* Prevent automatic try at credit card encryption if no EncryptKey
  is present.

Filters
-------

* Add new filter, "next_sequential". Allows selection of a next-sequential
  value based on a field (and qualified by a field).   

  [filter op="next_sequential.survey_q.sort"][cgi sort][/filter]

  will:   

    1. Return the existing value if present.
    2. If existing value is blank, return max + 1 in the sort field,
       i.e. equivalent to: 

           SELECT sort FROM survey_q
       ORDER BY sort DESC
       LIMIT 1   

  If another argument of a field name is passed, i.e. 

    filter => 'next_sequential.survey_q.sort.sel',   

  then you get: 

       SELECT sort FROM survey_q
       WHERE sel = '[cgi sel]'
       ORDER BY sort DESC
       LIMIT 1   

  This allows a next-sequential numbering for things that need it.
  Developed to support general-purpose survey UI for Ton's excellent
  product rating system.

* Fix bugs in option_format filter. It would turn commas into new options;
  and alternate delimiters had no hope of working.

* Add options2line and line2options filters, allowing you to specify
  options in a textarea without comma separators and instead with one
  option per line.

Profiles
--------

* Add "future" profile comparator so that you can do:

    appointment_date=future 1 day "Sorry, we need some lead time."

  That allows you to check that a date value (ala the date widget) is
  in the future.

* Added "luhn" profile check for "LUHN-10"-encoded numbers.

* Enhance unique profile check to allow specification of a foreign key
  for uniqueness check.

Foundation
----------

* Add several different color schemes instead of only the Foundation Red.
  "blueyellow" is the new default.

* Change logos and such to reflect ICDEVGROUP instead of Red Hat.

* Add product_tree and product_flyout components to work with new
  menu editor.

* Change checkout display to work easier for DHTML browsers, old
  browsers should see much the same thing.

* Change order profiles and etc/log_transaction to do a more reliable
  job of order checking. If your database has transactions (i.e. Postgres),
  a failure in the log_transaction can cause a failure of the order.

* Added auth_code and tracking_number to transactions table to support
  charge settlement and shipping_tracking in the UI.

* category_vert_toggle component reworked by Randy Moore.

* new category_vertical_tree component by Rene Hertell.

UserTags
--------

* Fixed problem in [button] tag to make sure that the current button being 
  pressed is the only one whose mv_click_map_* variable gets set.

  This works around the problem of a user clicking one button, using the
  browser's Back button, then clicking on a different button, and both
  mv_clicks execute instead of just the most recent one.

* [history-scan ...] now escapes form parameters properly.

* Extended stripping of line endings by [import-fields] to 
  help people who import using files generated on non-Unix
  operating systems.

* Add [jsq] [/jsq] .. and [jsqn] [/jsqn] tags that build properly
  JavaScript strings (jsq with variable substitution, jsqn without).

* Add [tabbed-display] tag that shows DHTML tabbed panels.

        [tabbed-display OPTIONS]
            [tabbed-panel The title of one]
            The contents of one
            [/tabbed-panel]
            [tabbed-panel The titel of two]
            The contents of two
            [/tabbed-panel]
        [/tabbed-display]

  It is pretty much that simple. It is documented, and an example is
  on the pages/admin/genconfig.html page.

* [table-editor ...] tag updated extensively. Added tabbed displays,
  full templating of the display, user-includeable forms, almost all
  features supported with metadata.

* Many minor changes in metadata and preferences. Changed default
  in some tables to tabbed display.

* [update-order-status] tag added for shipping products. Also does
  charge settlement if needed.

* [xml-generator] removed.

UI
----

* Extensive update to look and feel of the admin UI. The HTML design was
  done by David and Hamish, core members from Zeald, Ltd. in New Zealand.
  There are no more BGCOLOR references, and only a couple of <font ..>
  tags. All has been switched to CSS.

* Remove icmenu database. That work now done by lib/UI/pages/include/menus/*.

* Major update to [table-editor ...] which so much of the UI is based
  around. 

    -- Tabbed displays
    -- Insert spreadsheet linked via foreign key
    -- Insert custom form widgets for form processing use,
           a "recompute transaction" included for an example
    -- Control over styles and classes for table columns
        -- Completely templateable

* Add the suggested feature from Dan Browning -- a great idea --
  a spreadsheet of a linked table within the table editor.

  Adds the options:

    link_table               Table to link in

    link_key                 Key field to link to

    link_fields              Columns to display

    link_sort                How to order the linked rows
                             (probably should add link_query here)

    link_view                The view for spreasheet meta

    link_label               How to label the thing (default
                             is something like "Settings in
                             link_table linked by link_key"

    link_before              Where to plop the thing, input
                             a column name in the main table to
                             put it before

    link_extra               Class, style, or other data for
                             the table cells in the spreadsheet


   To make it even better, multiple link tables are allowed,
   so you could do:

       [table-editor
            link-table.0=options
            link-table.1=pricing
            link-key.0=sku
            link-key.1=price_group
        ]

   To test, try this little test-snippet in a default foundation
   from the latest CVS.

    [table-editor
        table=products
        item_id="os28004"
        link-table=options
        link-key=sku
        link-fields="sku price description"
        link-sort="price desc"
        link-before="weight"
    ]

* Complete rework of content editor. Improvements too many to name.

    - "Edit page", "Edit menu", even "edit component" links are inserted when
      you are logged in as admin.

    - Complete cleanup of page/template/component parsing code, now perhaps
      someone besides Mike could understand it. 8-)

    - File navigator only now used for pages, not for templates/components,
      retains context.

    - Hooks are there for doing an entire edit session then pushing new content all
      at once. Theoreticially, you could create an entire new site, browse it
      and test it without the public seeing it, and then push one button to
      publish it all. I say theoretically because I haven't done it yet, but
      it should be there soon.

    - Preview now holds true for browsing catalog.

    - Now can create and edit pages that have no template wrapper.

    - Add page to clone (push) sets of components to like sets of pages, i.e.
      edit one to get the components like you want them and then select the
      pages that that setup should be copied to.

    - Closed all Bugzillas relating to it.
       -- New pages not creating properly
       -- Unable to edit in subdirectories
       -- Templates not written properly

    - TODO:

        -- Allow alternate DSN for staging database tables.
        -- Document this puppy, finally.
        -- Change templates so that left-side/right-side components interchange,
           and so that most class=content components can go vertical.
        -- Vet the new [menu][/menu] component so that left-hand side
           menu can be directory/location sensitive.
        -- Build in the "use the index.html page in the current directory
           as the template" functionality.
 
* Improve spreadsheet.

    -- Any meta widget can be used.
    -- No possiblity of data crossover with embedded nulls.
    -- Remove need for "Change display" with improved meta edit (will
       add temporary view selector soon).
    -- Better display (I think).
    -- Better consistency of display for data and new record, etc.
    -- Fields can use meta, go to textarea, have text field all selectable
       from spreadsheet meta control.

* Add cheesy mail list manager, a common thing to ask. Supported by unsubscribe
  function and a batch download mode for large mailings....probably should
  create some online help.

* Ability to employ database entries in filters supported by profile 
  "process_filter" now.

* Major update to order status update program. Now can batch ship by
  checking boxes, sequence ship, settle transactions previously done
  via auth_only with realtime payment gateway, and more.

* Many, many, minor bug fixes and improvements.

Swish Search
------------

* Added module to search indexes with Swish.

* To use, you must add to interchange.cfg:

        Require module Vend::Swish
        AddDirective Swish hash
        Variable swish Vend::Swish

* The search is called with st=swish (same as mv_searchtype=swish).

* The fields to return are configurable, and default to;

        rf=code score title url mod_date filesize
        fn=code score title url mod_date filesize

  These correspond to:

                        code            swishreccount
                        score           swishrank
                        url                     swishdocpath
                        title           swishtitle
                        filesize        swishdocsize
                        mod_date        swishlastmodified

mod_interchange
---------------

* Implemented a proper (automatic) URILevels mechanism and removed
  the URILevels configuration directive.  This also fixes a bug,
  reported by Philip Hempel in the interchange-users mail list,
  where [PT] redirects were not being handled correctly.

Forum
-----

* Add "forum" feature to foundation. Allows commenting on products and
  also as a byproduct arbitrary blog-style forums.

  This is a complete forum display:

        [forum top=THREAD_ID /]

  You can get more complex than that. There is an illustration of the
  templated version in the pages/forum/display.html page.

  Disabled by default for DBM and Oracle. No database def is
  supplied for Oracle.

  With Postgres and MySQL, the forum is displayed in the flypage
  automatically by default. The thread doesn't exist until the
  first comment is made, at which time we create a top-level thread
  named for the SKU.

  An email notification goes out with new comments if that is
  enabled.

  There is some scoring logic for display, but no way to assign
  scores yet (except by editing the database directly).

  The reply and submit pages use include files from include/forum.

  Arbitrary forums need to be enabled by setting the artid equal
  to the code. If the artid is 0, as is the default on a random
  submit, no display will be done. (The enabling is done automatically
  for products by passing the product=1 parameter in the URL and
  finding the product in the database.)


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 4.9.3 released only as nightly builds.


------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 4.9.2 released 2002-08-12.


Core
----

* New ability to run Interchange entirely inside Apache and mod_perl.
  See POD documentation inside scripts/ic_mod_perl.PL for details.

* Add new Jobs and Cron facility:

  - While we don't keep the time, and a scheduler will have to set the
    execution time, it allows ITL to be run without the hassles of having
    to deal with HTTP.
  - Use $Vend::Cfg->{Cron} for setup.
  - Emails either to command line address or $Vend::Cfg->{Cron}{email}
    (only if the cron job supplies output). Uses the $Vend::Cfg->{Cron}
    variables subject, from, reply_to and extra_headers.
  - Logs to $Vend::Cfg->{Cron}{log}
    (only if the cron job supplies output).
  - Can add session dump when $Vend::Cfg->{Cron}{add_session}.
  - Base directory set by $Vend::Cfg->{Cron}{base_directory}, defaults
    to etc/cron. If $Vend::Cfg->{Cron}{use_global} is set, 
    the same directory in $Global::ConfDir is scanned too.
  - The macros $Vend::Cfg->{initialize} and $Vend::Cfg->{autoload} are
    executed once resp. before each job.
 
* Add First and Last links to more-list, with ability to customize via
  [first-anchor] and [last-anchor] containers.

* Bye bye Wizard. Suggest anyone who wants it resurrect it and
  make it work properly...

* Add new menu editor and menu system. It is based around Vend::Menu
  and the new tag [menu ...], which builds various types of DHTMl and
  standard HTML menus based on browser type.

  The menu editor can edit simple menus or tree-based menus.
  All UI menus use this. A simple menu component (i.e. a link list)
  and a tree-based list are provided for Foundation.

* New support for database-native sequences for MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle:

  - To do a minimal sequenced table, all you need to do is:

    Database  sequenced sequenced.txt __DBIDSN__
    Database  sequenced AUTO_SEQUENCE sequenced_seq

  - The parameter passed to AUTO_SEQUENCE (in the above, "sequenced") will
    be used as the sequence name for Postgres and Oracle (and presumably
    others that emulate them).

    For MySQL, the same technique that Stefan introduced is used, with an
    AUTO_INCREMENT field. The value in AUTO_SEQUENCE is just a non-false
    value. The behavior depends on the definition of
    $capability->{LAST_SEQUENCE_FUNCTION}.

    If MySQL is the DB in use,

    $key = $s->autonumber();

    returns nothing and the key will be later found with

    $key = $s->last_sequence_value($key);

    and returned in $db->set_slice, etc. ($db->set_row also uses this, but
    the key value is never returned. You can get it with
    $db->last_sequence_value if you need it.)

    If PostgreSQL/Oracle is used, the key is returned with

    $key = $s->autonumber();

    and is just parroted back with

    $key = $s->last_sequence_value($key);

    If the table is being created, the sequence will be created as well. If
    it exists, it will not be dropped. If the "code" or key field is not
    set with a COLUMN_DEF, the field type to be used will be found in
    $capability->{SEQUENCE_KEY}.

    Capablility entries used:

    SEQUENCE_CREATE         Query to create a sequence on table creation.
    SEQUENCE_QUERY          Query to get next value in sequence.
    SEQUENCE_KEY            Type definition for key field when AUTO_SEQUENCE
                            table is created.
    SEQUENCE_VALUE_FUNCTION Query to get current value of sequence.
    SEQUENCE_LAST_FUNCTION  Query to get key when MySQL behavior is wanted.

  - Can automatically drop existing sequence if:

    Database sometable AUTO_SEQUENCE_DROP 1

* Add BASE_CAPABILITY configuration parameter to allow testing of a new
  SQL database type with settings based on one of the known types. If
  behavior is different in particulars, that capability can be modified
  in the config file.

* In Vend::Config, fix incompatibility in Perl 5.005-style regex that
  causes rejection of certain Locale settings.

* Remove unnecessary CGI variable mappings at end of Vend::Config.

* Fix call to [item-tag object name].

* Add Filter alias e = encode_entites.


Extensions
----------

* Various Quickbooks updates:

  - Fixed: When an auto-created user orders from the same company as an
    existing Quickbooks customer, it overwrites the customer.

  - Save the auto-created user id (e.g. U00001) and use it in the Customer
    Name as a unique identifier, just as logged-in users.

  - New variables for easy customization of export features via Admin UI,
    documented via item-specific meta referenced in the documentation.

  - Fixed: "INTL" showing up without country (now matches US or USA).

  - Put the company name on a separate line in Ship-to and Bill-to
    addresses. Now utilizing all 5 lines.

  - Item name updates:
    - Length filter now customizable via QB_ITEM_LENGTH
    - Default is 30 (backwards compatible)
    - Item name taken from 'title' first, if any, then 'description' second.

  - Optionally cause Quickbooks invoice number to be blank, to keep
    Quickbook's invoice number progression unmodified.
  
  - Accompanying documentation.

Utilities/EG
-------------

* eg/te -- jon's great tabbed file editor.

    Add some new options:

    -f to handle files without field names on first line of file.
    -n to number rows in comments.

    -s for starting value support (really only vi).

        te -s os28004 <file>

        Jumps to first occurrence of "os28004" in <file>. Option -i ignores case
        in the search.

    Allow setting of persistent options in environment variable TE_OPTIONS.

    Handle -i and -s with mixed-case search term (lowercase it first).

    Don't escape " in search term, as it doesn't seem special.

Payment
-------

* Support for TrustCommerce added. Written, tested, and donated by
  Dan Helfman of TrustCommerce <dan@trustcommerce.com>. Thanks, Dan!

* Support for the Mainstreet Credit Verification Engine (MCVE) added.
  Written, tested, and donated by Tom Friedel <tom@readyink.com>.
  Thanks, Tom!
 
* Support for ECHO added. Written, tested, and donated by
  Michael Lehmkuhl <michael@electricpulp.com>.  Ported from globalsub to 
  Vend::Payment by Dan Browning <db@kavod.com>.  Thanks Michael!

UI
--

* [import_fields]: Performance enhancement: use set_slice() to update all 
  fields in a record at once when importing files.
  

------------------------------------------------------------------------------


Interchange 4.9.1 released 2002-07-22


Core
----

* The great tag breakout!

    - Almost all tags are now UserTag definitions. The exceptions are:

        and bounce goto if label or unless

    - New TagDir directive (default is VENDROOT/code) sets the
      directory (or directories) which are searched for code definitions
      set by UserTag and CodeDef.

    - New TagGroup directive establishes groups of ITL tags which can
      be included.

        TagGroup :crufty "banner default ecml html_table onfly sql"

      The default groups include :core, which contains all of the
      ITL tags defined in 4.8/early 4.9. The groups are defined
      in $Vend::Cfg::StdTags and can be undefined if desired
      with "TagGroup :group".

    - New TagInclude directive allows inclusion of tags (or groups
      of tags). If a tag is defined as a core tag (with a .coretag
      or .tag or .ct extension) and is not included, it will not
      be compiled and placed in the tag map. This is for all catalogs,
      so if *any* catalog uses a tag it must be included.

      Examples:

        # Include the base tags
        TagInclude :core

        # Not the commerce tags
        TagInclude !:commerce

        # But make sure item-list is included even though
        # it is in :commerce
        TagInclude item-list

        ## Double negatives are honored
        TagGroup    :foo "bar !baz buz"
        ## With the group above, the below is equivalent
        ## to TagInclude !bar baz !buz
        TagInclude !:foo

    - New CodeDef directive allows the setting of filters, order checks,
      FormAction, ActionMap, ItemAction, and LocaleChange.

            ## filters
            CodeDef  mixedcase Filter
            CodeDef  mixedcase Routine <<EOR
            sub {
                my $val = shift;
                ## [filter mixedcase]mixed case[/filter]
                ## outputs "MiXeD CaSe"
                $val =~ s/(.)(.)/\u$1\l$2/g;
                return $val;
            }
            EOR

            ## order checks
            CodeDef  mixedcase OrderCheck
            CodeDef  foo  Routine <<EOR
            sub {
                my ($ref, $var, $val) = @_;
                return (1,$var) if $val eq 'bar';
                return (0,$var, "foo must be bar");
            }
            EOR

       All work in catalog.cfg; LocaleChange and ItemAction are not
       global. FormAction, ActionMap, and ItemAction directives
       are equivalent to their CodeDef equivalents.

* New Vend::Form module implements display tag and widget creation.
  Passes all known tests, and runs accessories/widgets (apparently)
  flawlessly in foundation, barry, simple, and the UI.

* Add new HIDE_FIELD capability to DbSearch. It provides automatic
  hiding of records accessed via search (and NOT query).

 -When the following configuration is added:

    Database products HIDE_FIELD inactive

 -It adds automatically the qualification to every search:

    WHERE inactive != 1

 -To use, you should have a field of char(1) or int type.

    Database products COLUMN_DEF "inactive=int default 0"

 -This has the side-effect of hiding fields with NULL in the
  field, so be careful. You should probably set "default 0"
  as shown above.

 -Works for DBM types too.

 -Does NOT work for TextSearch.

 -If you want to show all records, you can pass mv_no_hide=1
  in the search parameters. Obviously, this makes this not a
  security feature.

* Clear the following intermittent error:

    CGI mapping error: multipart/form-data sent incorrectly

  Some browsers, like Opera, use non-word characters like '+' in
  form-data MIME boundaries, causing the regex matches to fail.

* New function Vend::Util::logOnce which ignores repeated identical
  log messages (works only in the scope of the current Interchange
  page)

* Remove last remnants of mv_raw_searchspec.

* Remove HTML-embedded tag syntax

* Remove Vend::ECML, move to extensions/ directory.

* Allow customization of links in more-list, like this:
  [link-template]<a href="$URL$" target="_top">$ANCHOR$</a>[/link-template]

* Add utility functions Vend::Data::product_row and product_row_hash,
  which do the same thing as product_field, but return the whole row
  instead of just one field.


UI
--

* Major changes to the content editing scheme.

    - Requires a CSS/Javascript 1.3 compliant browser. Tested on
      Mozilla 0.9.8, MSIE 5.51, Opera 6.0tp2. All work pretty well;
      Mozilla is a bit slow, Opera doesn't have CSS widths down.

    - Page editor has a quasi-visual layout that should be much more
      intuitive. Support for a "PAGE_PICTURE" file in the templates
      allows visual links to the editor page.

    - Components, templates, and pages are now all editable.
      Template and component editors need to be brought up to speed
      with the page editor, but work fairly well.

    - Added new lib/UI/ContentEditor.pm module which implements
      this stuff in conjunction with lib/UI/pages/include/*_editor.
      A bit of a JavaScript dependency nightmare on the generated
      attribute editors, but I may get this more canned as time goes on.

    - Let's get this on record -- this content editiing WILL NOT
      UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES EVER WORK ON NETSCAPE 4. Do not ask,
      though I know the people who monitor this stuff won't.

* Added Mike's cool new "auto_wizard" which builds a wizard from a
  file like in the example. It will be the method to provide scripted
  content addition.

* More table-editor updates -- added notable option, and
  all_opts option which allows building the options in
  Perl and then doing:

        [table-editor all-opts=`\%opts`]

* Look for major updates on the table editor to make it
  completely templateable.

* Fix problem with $Tag->display() called with null table, affecting
  "wizard" mode.

* Add a "admin/test_code.html" page for testing short snippets
  of ITL without having to create a test page.

* Make the table populator JavaScript honor the db tables the
  particular admin user is supposed to see.

* [import-fields replace=1] -- added option to replace items in the database

* Add su facility for catalog superuser to switch users to another
  user id, using new UI_Tag su as follows:

    [su username=miltonbear]

    1. Stringifies current session after checking that su user is valid
    2. Writes a random string to "$Global::ConfDir/tmp/$Session->{id}"
    3. Issues a cookie hashing the above two
    4. Inits a new session, putting in the login info
    5. Writes $Session->{su} with session string

    [su exit=1]

    1. Reads random string from "$Global::ConfDir/tmp/$Session->{id}"
    2. Hashes that with session and verifies with cookie
    3. Safe evals session string
    4. Retrieves session username/admin info

    [su create_user=1 username=bobby password=howdy verify=howdy]

    Allows combined creation of new user and switching to that user. 
    Any options you would pass to userdb tag can be given to su usertag, 
    to tweak account creation. If user already exists, it's silently switched to.

  MMsu profile is called on admin/customer.html to run the switch.

  When you "log out", you are reverting to the previous user, and you
  can go no further back. So if you go from superuser->adminuser, then
  adminuser->regular user, there is no way back to superuser without
  logging in again.

* Continuing work on meta_display and Vend::Form.

    - Relocated date and option widgets
    - Prepared for breaking out image widgets to code/Widget
    - Fixed various bugs in widgets
    - Code simplification in Primitive.pm
    - Fix widget.coretag to not call UI::Primitive routine
    - Redo option_format filtering

* Display server hostname on the information page (genconfig).

* Unused usertags component, set-alias and set-click removed.


Payment
-------

* Support for Wells Fargo added


Accounting
----------

* Vend::Accounting module added, along with example module for SQL_Ledger.
  This is the basis for a start of a defined accounting system interface.

  Some intended functions:
    NOTE: AS = Accounting Software, i.e. SQL-Ledger, IC = Interchange

    1. Assign customer number
    2. Change customer information based on input, limit to fields customer
       should have control over
    3. Add sales transaction (IC)
    4. Feed back sales transaction from AS side for account status
    5. Enter payments (IC --> AS), with credit-cards used to pay invoices
    6. Reconcile AS account status with IC, i.e. ship status
    7. Cancel order (IC)
    8. Ship portion or all of order (IC)
    9. Mark order complete

    Input on other functions needed is appreciated.

PROPOSED:

* Set of modules selectable by route handle:

    Vend::Account::SQL_Ledger (exists)
    Vend::Account::QuickBooks (proposed)
    Vend::Account::Compiere (proposed)
    Vend::Account::[fill-in-the-blank]

* Use a usertag [account] (a la [charge]) to interface functions.

* Use a profile primitive, "&account=label function" ala "&charge="
  to do some accounting functions in profiles, notably getting an
  order number or customer number

* Allow either COMMIT or no-COMMIT operation, with tradeoffs

* Define accounting system parameters via Route, and build
  in accounting functions into Route so that they can be
  a predicate for order success.

* Define two transitional state tables for handshaking:

    orderstatus -- status of orders, i.e.
            pending,transmitted,received,shipped,complete

    accountstatus -- record of payments and orders for account statement


Foundation demo
---------------

* use [if variable MV_DEMO_MODE] instead of the more cumbersome
  [if type=explicit compare="__MV_DEMO_MODE__"].

* add global INTERCHANGE_URL and INTERCHANGE_EMAIL variables to be used
  for the Interchange developer website & email contact points, instead
  of hard-coded stuff

* standardize on the short form "Interchange" for the application name.

* update a few URLs, etc.

* Remove history-scan tag from catalog.cfg; it is now in code/UserTag.

* Remove no_html_parse pragma, for which code has already been deleted.

* Moved payment routes to the top of the Route stack. Technically they
  should not be below the default route, and though it works in the
  standard foundation setup, it caused lots of failures when people
  tried to customize their order routing.

* (Oracle) Add missing Database xxx UPPERCASE 1 settings. Thanks to
  Jonathan Lee <jonalee740304@yahoo.com> for reporting.

* Get rid of weird tax rate popup notice when updating account
  info, which is especially strange when you've never had anything
  in your cart ...

* Change catalog.cfg to highlight etc/after.cfg.


UserTags
--------

* [fedex-query] -- Stop dying if there's a problem with FedEx express
  lookups, which kept even ground rate lookups from being done during
  the first request when the Business::Fedex object is first created.

  Instead, just log the error but continue on with possible ground lookup.

  (This situation resulted in the oddity of the shipping rate displaying
  as $0.00 on the checkout page, but still getting added into the total cost
  and displaying in the shipping rate pulldown select box just fine.)
  
* interchange.cfg: Remove now-redundant include of usertag/*.tag.

* [db-columns] -- Add ability to get back an array instead of a joined string
  to $Tag->list_databases,$Tag->list_keys,$Tag->db_columns,

* [email] -- Add enhancement made by Jurgen Botz to use send_mail program
  so that Net::SMTP can send the email tag. Thanks Jurgen!

* [history_scan] -- Count option added, which guarantees that the
  returned link is at least count # of clicks back in the page history.

* [image] -- descriptionsfields and exists_only options added.


Build
-----

* Removed stale POD documentation from main interchange repository; for
  some time now, docs source has been in SDF format in docs repository
  and available in separate docs package.

* Keep test from giving warning about not being able to stat
  "code" directory.

* Big changes to RPM specfile:

  - Allow non-root RPM builds.
  - Don't add interch user on build machine.
  - Don't automatically start Interchange after installing RPM.
  - Remove unneeded .empty files used in CVS to avoid pruning
    important but empty directories.
  - Make admin UI images owned by root.
  - Don't allow Interchange RPMs to own /usr/share/man/man[18] system
    directories.
  - Start using RPM dependencies for Perl CPAN modules. Users who
    install directly from CPAN will have to use --nodeps.
  - Start daemon in UNIX mode only by default.
  - Build foundation-demo RPM with MV_DEMO_MODE set.
  - On uninstall, remove autogenerated /usr/lib/interchange/etc/varnames
  - Start using Red Hat standard /sbin/service instead of directly
    running /etc/rc.d/init.d/interchange.
  - Add standard 'reload' function as alias for restart.
  - Quell /sbin/service stop errors.
  - Let user see if we turn off old IC server before install/upgrade.
  - Make packages architecture-dependent, to save lots of hassles.
  - Stop checking for /home/httpd, but use a define for webdir
    that can easily be changed if needed.
