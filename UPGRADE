          U P G R A D I N G   F R O M  3 . 0 x

You should normally be able to simply install over the
current software and then restart the server.  The only 
incompatible changes are bug fixes (which may fool any
workarounds you have made).

The "simple" demo runs unchanged from MiniVend 3.05 to
3.06. The usual source of any upgrade problems is illegal
syntax in tags, which might work on earlier versions but
is rejected in later, stricter versions. Especially check
nested [if ...] tags -- some problems can be solved by
putting a [then] [/then] around the true-executed condition.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  It is highly recommended that you copy the
current software to a backup directory or an archive in case
there is a problem and you wish to return to the earlier
version.

See the file WHATSNEW for more information.

There are a few "gotchas" for 2.0x upgrades:

    * If you have not changed the PriceBreaks directive from
      the demo (you should disable it unless you are actually
      using quantity pricing) you will get a message in the
      error log that "no pricing database is defined". If you
      are using quantity pricing, you will have to set it up
      as a database with at least the fields "sku" and "price"
      by placing those words on the first line, separated by
      a TAB -- and your pricing must be separated from the 
      part number by a TAB as well.

    * The CheckoutFrame, OrderFrame, SearchFrame, and any
      other frame settings are now empty by default. If you
      use frames, you must explicitly define those directives.

    * Perl 5.002 will not work with MiniVend 3.0, and you
      must update.

    * The Cookies directive is now enabled by default.

    * If you have produced a custom catalog template for use
      by the makecat program, you cannot place two directives
      directly after one another.  An example is the 
      VendURL definition of '__MVC_SERVERNAME__MVC_CGIURL'.
      That now must be '__MVC_SERVERNAME____MVC_CGIURL__' 
      which places underscores around the entire name of the
      substitution target.

    * If you are still using the old-style report with $variable
      substitution, you must define the NewReport directive to 'No'.

    * If you use the 'f' formula shipping type in shipping.asc, you
      must either replace the 'x' that was used for the substitution
      of the total to @@TOTAL@@, or you must set the OldShipping 
      to Yes.  The change to the shipping.asc file is recommended,
      as without it you will not be able to use the new shipping
      features of MiniVend.
