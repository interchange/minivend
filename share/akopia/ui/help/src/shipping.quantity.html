To begin, click on the plus sign once for each range you would like to enter. You can add or subtract more fields at any time, so don't worry. Hint: on some browsers, when you click the plus sign more than once, it won't register. In that case, click the "reload" button on your browser to make more fields appear.

The first range will automatically start with zero and the last range will automatically end with infinity. Note: Interchange automatically bases the beginning point of each range on the end of the last. If you end one range at five items, the next range will begin at six.
