<title>Customer</title>
<p>
The customer manager allows you to access information entered by visitors 
and customers of your site.
</p>

<p>
Customers are displayed by customer id and name. You can activate and
deactivate customers much the same way you can archive and unarchive orders.
Deactivating an entry merely puts it in the deactivated list so that you don't
have to see it with the customers on the active list.
</p>

<p>
To view detailed customer information click on a customer name(s)
and then click "view customer". You will be able to view information
such as the customer's phone, company, email address, billing address,
and payment types.
</p>

<p>
To search for a specific customer type the customer's name in the text
box field and click "start list here".
</p>

<p>
You can also enter new orders from this screen. This is useful, for example,
if you also allow customers to call in orders, or if you wish to use Interchange
as a point of sale system.
