<title>Order Statistics</title>
<p>
The order statistics feature helps you see at a glance how your store is doing. You can view your stats for any day or range of days. In addition to meus that allow you to pick a particular range of days we have shortcut buttons that show you the stats for yesterday, the last seven days and the last 30 days. You can either view stats as an overview or see the individual orders for that time period. By default, it will show you yesterday's stats.
