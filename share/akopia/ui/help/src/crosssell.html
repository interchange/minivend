The <b>Cross-Sell</b> page is used to exercise the Cross-Sell marketing feature. The Cross-Sell feature allows you to display an item or items that compliment the item the customer has chosen and give the customer the choice of adding the complimentary item. For example, you may choose to display a paintbrush as a Cross-Sell item to a customer that is purchasing paint.

  to the original flat text file. This feature allows you to keep your original 
  files up-to-date and portable. However, while this feature may not hinder the 
  system's performance when exporting a small table, exporting a large table may 
  slow your system.
