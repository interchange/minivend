<title>Site Layout</title>
<p>
The <b>Site Layout Editor</b> can be used to manage the content on your site.
Content is divided into sections, and you can create subsections of each 
section, much like directories and subdirectories on a disk.
</p>

<p>
Selecting a section on the left shows information about it on the right.
Click <b>Create New Section</b> to create a new top level section, or select an
existing section and click <b>Create Subsection</b> to create a new section under
the existing section heading.
</p>

<p>
Sections come in three types: product pages, content pages, and links to
foreign pages. In future releases of Interchange, you'll be able to 
control many page attributes without having to edit the templates by hand.
</p>

<p>
Product pages are for listing items in your inventory. Generally, you'll
create a section for each kind of item in your store, so that visitors can
browse your items easily. If you have many kinds of items, you may want to
list their sections together under a <b>Products</b> section. When you've selected
a section that is a product page, you will be presented with a list of items
in that section and options for adding and deleting items in that section.
Deleting an item from a section doesn't actually delete the item from your store; the <b>Items</b> page is used for that.
</p>

<p>
Content pages are pages which primarily contain information about the site and
don't list any items. You can choose from pages you've uploaded with the
file uploader.
</p>

<p>
Links to foreign pages provide an easy way to link to another site.
