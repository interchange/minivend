<title>Layout Manager</title>
<p>
The site layout manager is the interace that a designer or product manager uses to assign products to a page, manage elements on the page such as links, do merchandizing like specifying featured products, and rearranging elements on the pages. 
</p>

<p>
When you enter this page, you see first a listing of the main pages linked on the front page of your web site and other elements on that page such as featured products or navigation bars. We call these the "children" of the front page. If you click on the name of one of these children, the list will expand to show you the children of that element, and so on. Next to the name of each child is a radio button. select the button of the element you want to work with before clicking any of the buttons at the bottom of the page. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Add as child</b><br>
You can add three types of children to any particular element: items, groups, and pages. The pull-down menus below the list display the available children. To add children to a page, first click the radio button next to that page's name in the list, then select either a group, page, or item from the pull-down menus. Then click on the "add as child" button. You should see the new child appear under its parent automatically.

<b>Rearrange Children</b><br>
The order that the children appear in this list is important, as it determines the order in which they will be displayed on the site. The "rearrange children" feature lets you place them in the correct order. First click the radio button next to the parent whose children you want to arrange, then click on the "rearrange children" button. That will take you to a new screen with a list of all the children in order. Select each child that you want to move, then click the "up" or "down." continue this process until they're in the right order, then click "ok" Clicking cancel will take you back without making any changes, even if you've already rearranged some of your products.

<p>
<b>Move Some Children/Move all Children</b><br>
If you want to move children out from under one parent over to another, these two functions will do that. "move some children" allows you to choose which of the children in the list you would like to move, then asks you which new parent to assign them under, while "move all children" simply moves them all. Below, see the move children screen. Notice you can "control click" to select more than one child to move.

<p>
<b>Hide All</b><br>
Just as clicking on the name of an element will make its children appear, clicking on the name again will make them disappear. If you have a lot of different parents' children showing, the "hide all" button will make them all disappear.
</p>

<p>
<b>Delete</b><br>
The delete button allows you to remove a child from the parent. select the child you would like to remove by clicking the button next to its name, then click on the delete button.
