<title>Affiliates</title>
<p>
An affiliates program allows the merchant to make linking agreements with the
owners of other web sites then track which orders come in from those off-site
links. In many cases, the partner site earn a percentage of the sale from
that link. In other cases, the merchant is simply interested in knowing how
many people are buying as a result of a particular link.

<b>Create new affiliate</b><br>
Click this button to make a new affiliate. You will be asked to give that
affiliate a name. This name will appear in your personal list of affiliates
and will also appear on any orders resulting from this affiliate's links.
After you submit the new affiliate information, Interchange will display a
unique URL which you will need to email to your new affiliate. They will
receive credit for an order only if the purchaser originally clicked on that
specific URL.
</p>

<p>
<b>Default URL to redirect to</b><br>
When setting up your affilate, you have the choice of having their link point
to your front page, to any other page in your site, or perhaps to a welcome
page specifically for that affiliate's customers. Enter the complete URL in
this space. Note: do <i>not</i> enter the URL of the affiliate's web site in
this space.
</p>

<p>
<b>Timeout delay</b><br>
The amount of time you enter here, in seconds, is the time that purchasers
have between the time they enter your site through the link and when they must
purchase before their status expires. If you set this time to 60 seconds,
most purchasers will not have time to place an order and your affiliate would
not get credit for any of the sales. We recommend a setting in the thousands,
or a setting of zero, which disables this feature.
