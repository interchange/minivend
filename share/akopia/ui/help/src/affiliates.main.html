<title>Edit Affiliates</title>
<p> An Affiliates Program allows the merchant to make linking agreements with 
  the owners of other web sites then track which orders come in from those off-site 
  links. In many cases, the partner site earn a percentage of the sale from that 
  link. In other cases, the merchant is simply interested in knowing how many 
  people are buying as a result of a particular link. The <b>Edit Affiliates</b> 
  page allows you to edit Affilite information. </p>

<p> <b>Create New Affiliate</b><br>
  Click this button to make a new Affiliate. You will be asked to give that Affiliate 
  a name. This name will appear in your personal list of Affiliates and will also 
  appear on any orders resulting from this affiliate's links. After you submit 
  the new Affiliate information, Interchange will display a unique URL which you 
  will need to email to your new Affiliate. They will receive credit for an order 
  only if the purchaser originally clicked on that specific URL. </p>

<p> <b>Default URL to Redirect to</b><br>
  When setting up your Affilate, you have the choice of having their link point 
  to your front page, to any other page in your site, or perhaps to a welcome 
  page specifically for that Affiliate's customers. Enter the complete URL in 
  this space. Note: do <i>not</i> enter the URL of the Affiliate's web site in 
  this space. </p>

<p> <b>Timeout Delay</b><br>
  The amount of time you enter here, in seconds, is the time that purchasers have 
  between the time they enter your site through the link and when they must purchase 
  before their status expires. If you set this time to 60 seconds, most purchasers 
  will not have time to place an order and your Affiliate would not get credit 
  for any of the sales. We recommend a setting in the thousands, or a setting 
  of zero, which disables this feature. </p>

<p> <b>Edit Affiliate</b><br>
  Select an Affiliate's name from the list, and click "Edit Affiliate" to review 
  or change the Affiliate information. If you forget the URL that the Affiliate 
  needs to use, it is displayed in the "Edit Affiliate" screen. </p>

<p> <b>Show Orders</b><br>
  This feature will review the number, amounts, and specifics of all orders attributed 
  to a particular affiliate. Select the Affiliate from the list and click "Show 
  Statistics." </p>

<p>
<b>Show Traffic</b><br>
This button will allow you to view information on the number of visitors who
have come to your site via the selected affiliate.
</p>

<p> <b>Delete Affiliate</b><br>
  Select the Affiliate from the list and click "Delete Affiliate" to remove it. 
  You will be asked to confirm your choice, after which it can not be recovered. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Affiliate Relations</b><br>
  You may also choose to allow the Affiliate to view the statistics for the traffic 
  on your site to which they are responsible. You can do this by allowing them 
  a restricted amount of access. (See the <a href="access.main.html">Access Manager</a> 
  for details.) </p>

<p> Note: the affiliates feature requires that the purchaser's computer accept 
  cookies. Keep in mind that some purchasers may have their browsers set to reject 
  cookies or may be using browsers that do not support them. </p>
