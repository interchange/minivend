<title>Items: Edit/Create</title>
<p>
Creating or editing an item is as easy as filling in its fields.
Common fields include "Short Description", "Long Description" and "Image",
which are used when displaying an item on a catalog page, and "Product price"
and "Weight in pounds", which are used when calculating charges in the shopping
basket.
</p>

<p>
The "Category" field can be used to select which category pages the item 
will appear on. Multiple categories can be selected. For more control
of product categories, choose "Site Layout" from the quicklinks menu.
</p>

<p>
A "meta" link may also appear under each field name. This will allow you 
to set various advanced options relating to the way each field is displayed
and the way data in the field is interpreted.
