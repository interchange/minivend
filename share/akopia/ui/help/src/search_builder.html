<title>Search Builder</title>
<p>
The search builder can be used to generate very complex reports on the database,
or to help in the construction of MML templates.
</p>

<p>
Select a "Base table" which will be the foundation for the report. Specify
the maximum number of rows to be returned at once, and whether to show only
unique entries.
</p>

<p>
The "Search filter" then allows you to narrow down the list of rows returned
by matching columns of the table based on various criteria. Up to three
separate conditions may be specified. The returned rows must match all criteria.
</p>

<p>
Finally, select any sorting options you wish the results to be displayed by, 
and narrow down the list of columns returned if you wish.
</p>

<p>
Clicking "Run" will run the search immediately and display the results.
"Generate definition" will display an MML tag which can be placed in a template
and which will return the results when executed.
