<title>Shipping Options</title>
<p>
The <b>Shipping Options</b> page allows you to specify and configure the shipping methods and costs for your online store. Before you begin here, you need to decide how you want to charge for shipping. We support all the most common shipping options:
</p>

<p>
<a href="shipping.price.html">By Price:</a> shipping total based on the total price of the order. This can also be used to calculate a flat shipping price ($0 - infinity = $4.95) or a flat rate with big orders shipped free ($0 - 500 = $4.95 and $500 - infinity = free). The shipping charge can either be a flat charge or a percentage.
</p>

<p>
<a href="shipping.weight.html">Standard by Weight: </a> calculates shipping by total weight with no regard to zones. To use this method, you must enter a weight for each item in your inventory. You can use any unit of measure you wish as long as you are consistent. If you enter your item prices in grams, then configure shipping with pounds, your customers will not be happy when they are quoted huge shipping rates. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="shipping.quantity.html">Standard by Quantity:</a> this is identical to shipping by price, but the shipping charge will be multiplied by the total number of items ordered. 
</p>

<p>
<a href="shipping.ups.html">UPS Zones-Based:</a> Interchange is pre-configured with UPS zones tables for ground, three day select, second day air, and next day air.
</p>

<p>
If you require zones support for Fedex, DHL, or USPS, please <a href="mailto:info@akopia.com">contact Akopia</a>.
</p>

<p>
Keep in mind that you can choose a variety of these shipping methods, giving the customer a choice. Many companies use flat shipping for ground orders and use UPS zones shipping for second day and next day orders.
</p>

<p>
<b>Create New Method</b><br>
Once you've decided what shipping options you are going to offer your customers, click the "Create New Method" button and configure each option. You will be able to name and configure each option from the "Create New Method" screen. See the next topic, <b>Edit Method</b>, for details.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="shipping.edit.html">Edit Method</a></b><br>
Select one of the currently existing shipping methods from the list and click "edit method" to change its name, enable or disable it, change the calculation method, or set a minimum charge. The "edit method" button takes you to the same screen as "create new method" button, but already filled out. To edit the individual charges for different prices or weights, use the "edit data table" function.
</p>

<p>
<b><a href="shipping.data.html">Edit Data Table</a></b><br>
The process of creating a new method is usually a two-step process. In the first step, you name the shipping method and devide on a calculation algorithm (by price, by weight/zone, etc). The second stage involves configuring your chosen method. The "edit data table" function allows you to change the particular settings for an already-created method.
</p>

<p>
<b>Delete Method</b><br>
Select a method from the list and click on this button to delete it. You will be asked to confirm your choice. If you choose yes, it will be deleted permanently. If you merely want to temporarily disable a particular shipping method and remove it from the list your customers see, edit the method and un-check the box next to "enable this method." That way, if you want to enable it later, you won't have to re-configure it.
