<title>Knar Editor</title>
<p>
Knar stands for "Knar's Not A Registry." It's kind of like a registry.
</p>

<p>
The Knar table stores store-wide configuration information. If you don't know
about store-wide configuration, it probably won't help you much. On the other
hand, if you just can't find the place to tweak the value you're looking for,
it might be worth poking around (gently!) in here.
