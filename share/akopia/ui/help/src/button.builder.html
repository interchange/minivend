<title>Button builder</title>
<p>
The button builder lets you create HTML links and buttons for ordering items
in your store.
</p>

<p>
This is handy if you have a few products to list on an HTML page by hand,
or if you want to put an order link on a page on another site, for example.
</p>

<p>
The button builder can generate either a URL for use in an &lt;A HREF...&gt;
HTML tag, or a submit button inside of a &lt;FORM&gt; tag. Select the item
or items you want to be added to the shopping basket when the button or link
is clicked. You can specify the quantity for allowing several of the selected
item to be purchased at once, and specify whether multiple items will be
displayed and edited as groups or individually. You can also set product
options such as size and color to be pre-set in the shopping cart when the
button or link is selected.
