<b>OK</b><br>
After completing the necessary information on the page, click <b>OK</b> to commit your changes/additions. The page is refreshed and the changes are committed.

<b>Auto-export</b><br>
Click this checkbox to enable the auto-export feature. The auto-export feature exports the changes you are committing to the tables described on these pages to the original flat text file. This feature allows you to keep your original files up-to-date and portable. However, while this feature may not hinder the system's performance when exporting a small table, exporting a large table may slow your system.
