<title>UPS Zones-Based Shipping</title>
<p>
Interchange is pre-configured with UPS zones tables for Ground, Three Day Select, Second Day Air, Second Day Air AM, Next Day Air Saver, and Next Dday Air. 
</p>

<p>
If you require zones support for FedEx, DHL, or USPS, please <a href="mailto:info@akopia.com">contact Akopia</a>.
</p>

<p>
There are no tables to configure if you select these options, but to use zones-based shipping, you need to enter the zip code of your shipping location. Interchange will automatically generate zones charts based on your zip code.
