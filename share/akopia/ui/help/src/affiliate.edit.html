<b>URL</b><br>
The value in this field is used to direct visitors coming from the Affiliate you are editing to your home page or a page designed specifically for visitors from that Affiliate's site. <br>

<p> <b>Timeout Delay</b><br>
The value in this field is used to specify the amount of time a customer has to place an order and still give the Affiliate credit for it. If the customer goes over this amount of time, the Affiliate doesn't get credit for the customer visit. The timeout delay is measured in seconds, with the value of 0 (zero) disabling it. It is recommended that you use a value in the thousands to be sure the customer has enough time to shop.
