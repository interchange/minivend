<title>Affiliates: Edit Affiliate</title>
<p>
Affiliates have the following attributes:
</p>

<p>
"Affiliate ID" is displayed in the order and traffic statistics along with the
orders and traffic they produce.
</p>

<p>
"Affiliate Name" is, remarkably, the name of the affiliate.
</p>

<p>
"campaigns" can be used to track traffic from advertising campaigns.
</p>

<p>
"join_date" can be used to keep track of when the affiliate signed up.
</p>

<p>
"URL" is used, if present, to redirect visitors coming from this affiliate
to a special home page just for visitors from that affiliate's site. This
should <i>not</i> be the URL of the Affiliate's home site.
</p>

<p>
"Timeout delay" can be used to specify that orders attributed to this affiliate
must happen within a certain amount of time from the time they were referred to
the site by the affiliate. Measured in seconds.
