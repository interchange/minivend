The <b>Edit Affiliate</b> page allows you to edit specific attributes for an Affiliate. The following is a list of some of the most common attributes that you can edit.
<p>
<h2>Functions</h2>

<b>Affiliate ID</b><br>
This field contains the <b>Affiliate ID</b> for the Affiliate you are editing. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Affiliate Name</b><br>
This field contains the name of the Affiliate you are editing.
</p>

<p>

</p>

<p>
<b>Join Date</b><br>
The value in this field can be used to keep track of when the Affiliate signed up.
</p>

<p>
<b>URL</b><br>
The value in this field is used to direct visitors coming from this Affiliate to your home page or a page designed specifically for visitors from that Affiliate's site. <br>
This should <i>not</i> be the URL of the Affiliate's home site.
</p>

<p>
<b>Timeout delay</b><br>
The value in this field is used to specify the amount of time a customer has to place an order and still give the Affiliate credit for it. If the customer goes over this amount of time, the Affiliate doesn't get credit for the customer visit. The timeout delay is measured in seconds, with the value of 0 (zero) disabling it. It is recommended that you use a value in the thousands to be sure the customer has enough time to shop.
