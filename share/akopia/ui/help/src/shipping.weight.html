<title>Shipping by Weight</title>
<p>
<b>Standard Shipping by Weight:</b> This calculates shipping by total weight with no regard to zones. Weight-based shipping with zones are marked by the company whose zones the algorithm calculates by, i.e., <a href="shipping.ups.html">UPS</a>. To use this method, you must enter a weight for each item in your inventory.

<i>Note: You can use any unit of measure you wish as long as you are consistent: if you enter your item prices in grams then configure shipping with pounds, your customers will not be happy when they are quoted huge shipping rates.</i>

To begin, click on the plus sign once for each range you would like to enter. You can add or subtract more fields at any time, so don't worry. <i><b>Hint</b>: on some browsers, when you click the plus sign more than once, it won't register. In that case, click the "reload" button on your browser to make more fields appear. The first range will automatically start with zero and the last range will automatically end with infinity.</i>

<p>
Create all the ranges you need and give each range a charge amount. In case you would like to charge a percentage of the order total as the shipping and handling charge, you have the option of specifying a percentage for any of the ranges. Note: Interchange automatically bases the beginning point of each range on the end of the last. If you end one range at 5 kg, the next range will begin at 5.00001 kg.
