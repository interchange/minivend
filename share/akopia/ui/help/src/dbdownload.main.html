<title>Database Download</title>
<p></p>
<p>
The <b>Database Download</b> page allows you to export any of the internal
tables on Interchange to the <b>backup</b> directory of your catalog. By
default, it exports each table to a tab-delimited file named for the table.
It also can export Gnumeric simple-text output and, if you have the Perl Spreadsheet::WriteExcel module installed, it can write XLS spreadsheet files.

<blockquote>
NOTE: XLS output is only available when you have the Spreadsheet::WriteExcel
module installed.  Spreadsheet::WriteExcel is available at CPAN.
</blockquote>

<p>
To use, take the following steps:

<OL>
	<LI>Check the boxes corresponding to the tables you want to export.
	<LI>Select whether you want Gnumeric output and/or XLS output.
	<LI>Click <B>Perform Export</B> button.
</OL>
NOTE: If you have very large database tables, the export function may take a
long time. It is not recommended for more than 25,000 products.

<P>
Once the tables are exported to a Gnumeric or XLS format, they will be
available for download on the same page. Individual tables are downloadable
via the <I>File Transfer</I> menu.
<P>
Caveats:
<P>
<UL>
	<LI>Fields longer than 255 characters will be wrapped to the next line
	and must be combined in the spreadsheet to be re-imported.
</UL>
