<title>Table Import</title>
<p>
The <b>Table Import</b> page allows you to upload a file from your computer
to Interchange in order to update one of Interchange's internal tables. This can be done in one of several formats.
</p>

<p>
Select a tab-delimited file to send to Interchange by clicking <b>Browse...</b>,
and a table to update from the list on the right. Then select whether to
add new rows from your file to the table, or to only update rows that are in
both your file and the table.
