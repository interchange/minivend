<title>Statistics</title>
<p>
The <b>Order Statistics</b> feature allows you to see at a glance how your store is doing.
You can view your statistics for any day or range of days. In addition to menus
that allow you to pick a particular range of days, there are shortcut buttons
that show you the statistics for the previous day, the past seven days, and the past 30
days. You can either view statistics as an overview or see the individual orders
for that time period. By default, the previous day's statistics are displayed.
