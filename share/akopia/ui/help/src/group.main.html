<title>Administrator Groups</title>
<p>
The <b>Admin Group Manager</b> page allows you to create and edit  entire groups of users at one time, without having to access each user's individual profile, and restrict the use of certain Administration Site functions on a per group basis. This feature is useful if you want to limit access to the Interchange Administration Site for an entire group of users.
