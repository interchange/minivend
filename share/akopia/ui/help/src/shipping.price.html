<title>Shipping by Price</title>
<p>
Shipping total based on the total price of the order. This can also be used to calculate a flat shipping price ($0 - infinity = $4.95) or a flat rate with big orders shipped free ($0 - 500 = $4.95 and $500 - infinity = free). The shipping charge can either be a flat charge or a percentage.

To begin, click on the plus sign once for each range you would like to enter. You can add or subtract more fields at any time, so don't worry. <i><b>Hint</b>: On some browsers, when you click the plus sign more than once, it won't register. In that case, click the "reload" button on your browser to make more fields appear. The first range will automatically start with zero and the last range will automatically end with infinity.</i><p> If you want one flat rate charge, only create one range, from zero to infinity and give it a charge amount. Otherwise, create all the ranges you need and give each range an amount. In case you would like to charge a percentage of the order total as the shipping and handling charge, you have the option of specifying a percentage for any of the ranges. Note: Interchange automatically bases the beginning point of each range on the end of the last. If you end one range at $50.00, the next range will begin at $50.01.
