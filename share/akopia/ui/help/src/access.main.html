<title>Administrator Accounts</title>
<p>
The <b>Administrator Accounts</b> page allows an administrator to create user accounts or groups
of users and restrict the use of certain features. This feature is 
useful if want to restrict access to sensitive areas of the Interchange Administration Site for certain employees. For instance, you may have one user or user group that you want to have access to order and customer information, but not to web content.
</p>

<p>
<i><b>Hint:</b> By default, users in the back office are stored and managed
separately from customer login accounts.</i>
</p>

<p>
Users can have permissions granted on an individual basis, or by group. A <b>Super user</b> has access to all Interchange Administration Site areas, regardless of how the permissions are set.
