<title>Administrators</title>
<p>
The access manager allows an administrator to create user accounts or groups
of users and restrict the use of certain features. This feature is espacially
useful if your company has employees to whom you would like to give the
ability to check orders, but not change web content.
</p>

<p>
Note that, by default, users in the back office are stored and managed
separately from customer login accounts.
</p>

<p>
Users can have permissions granted on an individual basis, or by group. If
a user is a "Super-user", all other permissions settings will be ignored and
the user will be allowed to do anything.
