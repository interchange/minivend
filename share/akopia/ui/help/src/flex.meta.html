<title>Meta information edit</title>
<p>
The <b>Meta information edit</b> page allows a user to edit the parameters of a displayed field. For example, if you click the <b>meta</b> link for the <b>Last Name</b> field, the <b>Meta information edit</b> page is displayed for that field. Editing the parameters in the <b>Meta information edit</b> page effects the values that will be accepted for the <b>Last Name</b> field. You could specify the width of this field, meaning the number of characters accepted, as 30 using the <b>Meta information edit</b> page. This would limit the length of any value entered in the <b>Last Name</b> field to 30 characters.
<p>
The <b>Meta information edit</b> field is displayed only to Super users. Exercise caution when editing this page.

<h2>Features</h2>
<b>OK</b><br>
After entering the necessary values, click <b>OK</b>. The following is a description of some of the displayed fields.
<ul>
<p>
<li>"Widget type" specifies the HTML INPUT tag type to use when displaying the field
in, say, the item editor.
</p>

<p>
<li>"Width" and "Height" only apply to some of the "Widget type" options, for
instance the "Textarea" widget.
</p>

<p>
<li>"label" is displayed instead of the internal column name. For example, the
"category" column of the "products" table might have a label of "Product
Category".
</p>

<p>
<li>"help" is displayed below the column label, and helps describe the purpose of
the field to the user.
</p>

<p>
<li>"help url" can be used to link to a page giving more information on the field.
</p>

<p>
<li>"lookup" can be used when a field is acting like a foreign key into another
table. In that case, you'll probably want to use some sort of select box
as the widget type, and if you want to reference multiple rows in the destination
table, you'll probably want to use a multi select box, with "colons_to_null"
as the pre_filter, and "::" as the lookup_exclude.
</p>

<p>
<li>"filter" and "pre_filter" can be used to filter data destined for that field
or data read from that field, respectively.
</p>
