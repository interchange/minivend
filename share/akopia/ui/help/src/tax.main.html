The <b>Tax Manager</b> allows you to set up multiple sales tax rates that might apply 
to your customers. The simplest example, which would apply to most merchants, 
is one tax rate for those people in your state and one tax rate (0%) for those 
outside the state. Of course, your business might have multiple locations or 
your state might have different tax rates by city, so you have the option of 
creating an unlimited number of tax rate choices.
</p>

<p>
To begin, specify the location to which the tax rate will apply. To create
a new entry, click on the red <b>+</b>, then enter the amount of tax to
be applied to orders which specify that location during checkout.
</p>

<p>
If you're done, click on the <b>OK</b> button. Otherwise, click the plus sign and 
continue until you've created all the rates you need.
</p>

<p>
If you need to delete any of the rates, of if you accidentally created too 
many fields, click the red <b>X</b> next to that rate.
</p>

<p>
If your company has many locations or your sales tax needs are very 
complicated, Interchange can be set up to work with third party tax software.
