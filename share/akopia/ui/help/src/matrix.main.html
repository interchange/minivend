<title>Matrix Editor</title>
<p>
<b>What is a Matrix?</b><br>
A matrix is a table of all the possible combinations of options available for an item. For example, a golf club can have options for mens and ladies, right and left handed, several shaft types and flexes, and different lofts, or head angles. But not all lofts are available in left handed, and some aren't available in ladies, and graphite shafts cost extra and all have different SKUs. The matrix contains all the variables. A simple matrix might be a size matrix, which has small, medium, large, and extra large. You would then be able to apply a unique sku or price or inventory information to each variation of each item.
</p>

<p>
A matrix can be specified for a particular item in the <a href="item.editor.html">Item Editor</a>, but each matrix must first be created in the matrix editor.
</p>

<p>
<b>Create new matrix</b><br>
Here, give your new matrix a descriptive name, such as "drivers and fairway woods" or "build-to-order bikes."
</p>

<p>
<b>Edit matrix</b><br>
This feature allows you to edit the name. To edit the matrix's dimentions, use the "show dimentions" feature.
</p>

<p>
<b>Show dimentions</b><br>
This feature allows you to create new dimentions and create ranges underneath those dimentions. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Create new dimension</b><br>
Like the "create new matrix" feature, "create new dimension" simply lets you specify a name for the dimension. Each matrix can have an unlimited number of dimensions.
</p>

<blockquote>
Example: the "drivers and fairway woods" matrix will have dimensions for shaft type, flex, right/left handed, and loft.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Edit dimension</b><br>
This feature allows you to edit the name. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Show ranges</b><br>
This feature will take you to another screen where you can create and edit ranges under that dimension.
</p>

<p>
<b>Create new range</b><br>
This will allow you to give your new range a name. Each dimension can have an unlimited number of ranges.
</p>

<blockquote>
Example: The "flex" dimension of the "drivers and fairway woods" matrix will have range entries for light, firm, and stiff.
