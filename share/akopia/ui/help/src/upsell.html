The <b>Upsell</b> page is used to exercise the Upsell marketing feature. The Upsell feature allows you to display an item of better quality and/or price then the one the customer has chosen and give the customer the choice of upgrading to this item. For example, you may choose to display a deluxe toolbox to a customer that is purchasing a standard toolbox.
