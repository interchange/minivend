<p>
The <b>Up-Sell</b> page is used to exercise the Up-Sell marketing feature. The Up-Sell feature allows you to display an item of better quality and/or price than the one the customer has chosen and give the customer the choice of upgrading to this item. For example, you may choose to display a deluxe toolbox to a customer that is purchasing a standard toolbox.

However, while this feature may not hinder the system's performance when exporting a small table, exporting a large table may slow your system.
