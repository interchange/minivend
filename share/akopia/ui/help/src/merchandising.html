<title>Merchandising</title>
<p>
The <b>Merchandising</b> page allows you to edit how the product items displayed are promoted. For example, you might notice the trend that customers who buy hammers also buy nails. Because of this, you might decide to use the cross-sell feature on this page to have nails displayed on the same page as hammers. You also might want to offer a discount to customers purchasing a certain quantity of one item.
