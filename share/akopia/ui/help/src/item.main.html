<p>
<b>Create New item</b><br>
Click this button to create a new item.
</p>

<p>
<b>Edit item</b><br>
Select an item from the list before clicking on "edit item." The screen will 
look the same as the create new item, but the fields will be ready to edit. 
For the changes to be recorded, click on the OK button at the bottom of the 
edit item screen. Using the browser's back button to exit the screen is fine, 
but the changes will not be recorded. Using the back button has the same 
effect as clicking on the cancel button. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Delete Item</b><br>
Select an item from the list that you would like to delete, and click on 
Delete. You will be asked for confirmation. If the choice is confirmed the 
item will be deleted -- permanently.
