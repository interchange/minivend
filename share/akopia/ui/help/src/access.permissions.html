<title>Administrator Permissions</title>
<p>
Here you can select which operations each administrator can perform in the
back office.
</p>

<p>
Each section of the back office can be restricted with fine-grained control.
An administrator can be given access to view the list of all orders, for
instance, but not allowed to view details.
</p>

<p>
Access to the rows of Interchange's internal tables can also be restricted on a
per-table basis for each administrator.
