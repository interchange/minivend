<title>Administrator Permissions</title>
<p>
The <b>Administrator Permissions</b> page allows you to select the operations that each user can have access to in the back office. Each section of the back office can be restricted with great detail. For example, a user can be given the ability to view a list of all orders, but not have access to the order details. Access to the individual rows of Interchange's internal tables can also be restricted on a per-table basis for each user.
