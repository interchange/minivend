<title>Administrator Permissions</title>
<p>
The <b>Administrator Permissions</b> page allows you to select the operations that each user can perform in the back office.

<p>
Each section of the back office can be restricted with great detail. For example, a user can be given the ability to view a list of all orders, but not have access to the order details.
<p>
Access to the individual rows of Interchange's internal tables can also be restricted on a
per-table basis for each user.
