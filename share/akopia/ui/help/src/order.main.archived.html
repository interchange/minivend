<title>Archived Orders</title>

The <b>Archived Orders</b> page displays all archived orders in the system. Orders are usually archived when they have been fulfilled. For an order to be displayed in the <b>Archived Orders</b> section, it must be manually moved from the <A HREF="order.main.pending.html">Pending Orders</a> section. This page works in real-time, but if you leave this page open or your Web browser has cached the page's contents, it is recommended that you re-load the page periodically 
to see the most recent orders.

<b>Delete False Order</b><br>
Periodically, either through fraud or because an order fell through after it was placed due to product availability problems, an order will need to be deleted and not reported in the order statistics. Select the false order from the list and click on the delete false order button. You will be asked for confirmation to delete this order, because once an order is deleted, it is irretrievable.
