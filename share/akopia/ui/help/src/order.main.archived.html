<title>Orders</title>
<p>
All on-line orders received are displayed in the Order Manager. 
The Order Manager works in real-time, therefore it will display all 
currently completed orders. However, the page must be re-loaded periodically 
to see the most recent orders if you leave the page open or your web browser 
has cached the page's contents. 
</p>

<p>
<b>Archived orders/Pending orders</b><br>
By default, the order manager shows the pending orders, that is, orders that 
have not yet been archived. So see the archived orders, click on the archived 
orders button. To return to pending orders, press the pending orders button.
</p>

<p>
<b>Order listings</b><br>
Orders are listed in a selection box showing order number, date, time and amount.
Select an order before clicking the "View Order", "Archive Order" or "Delete Order"
buttons.
</p>

<p>
<b>View order</b><br>
To view an item from the list, select it, then click on view order. All 
personal information (name, address, phone number), payment information 
(credit, C.O.D., etc.), and order information (items ordered, options 
selected, shipping, tax, and total), will be displayed.
</p>

<p>
<b>Archive order</b><br>
Select an order from the list and click on the archive order button to move it 
to the archived orders list. Archived orders can be kept for as long as you 
want. They will be accessible online. Alternately, you may choose to simply 
delete the orders after you have filled them.
</p>

<p>
<b>Delete Order</b><br>
If order information is stored somewhere else, simply delete the order from 
Interchange. The order will still be recorded in the order statistics.

<p>
<b>Delete False Order</b><br>
Periodically, either through fraud or because an order fell through after it was placed due to product availability problems, an order will need to be deleted and not reported in the order statistics. Select the false order from the list and click on the delete false order button. You will be asked for confirmation to delete this order, because once an order is deleted, it is irretrievable.
