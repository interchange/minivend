<b>Delete False Order</b><br>
Periodically, either through fraud or because an order fell through after it was placed due to product availability problems, an order will need to be deleted and not reported in the order statistics. Select the false order from the list and click on the delete false order button. You will be asked for confirmation to delete this order, because once an order is deleted, it is irretrievable.
