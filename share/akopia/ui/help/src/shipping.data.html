<title>Shipping: Edit Data Table</title>
<p>
Once you've created a shipping method, you can fine tune the calculation
based on the weight of the order. Use the "+" button to add new ranges
and specify which ranges will apply to which calculations. Choose a type
of calculation to perform for each weight range, such as a number (flat charge),
formula (arbitrary calculation based on the weight), UPS lookup (internal
or via their www site), Multiply by (simple rate), or select <b>Message</b> to
generate an error message. If you specify a formula, you can include the
string "@@TOTAL@@" to represent the total weight of the order. For example,
"8 + @@TOTAL@@ + 2.50".
