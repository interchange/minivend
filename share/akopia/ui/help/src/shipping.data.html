<title>Shipping: Edit Data Table</title>
<p>
Once you've created a shipping method, you can fine tune the calculation
based on the weight of the order. Use the "+" button to add new ranges,
and specify what ranges will apply to what calculations. Choose a type
of calculation to perform for each weight range - a number (flat charge),
formula (arbitrary calculation based on the weight), UPS lookup (internal
or via their www site), "Multiply by" (simple rate), or select "Message" to
generate an error message. If you specify a formula, you can include the
string "@@TOTAL@@" to represent the total weight of the order. For example,
"8 + @@TOTAL@@ + 2.50".
