=head1 NAME

Interchange CVS -- tracking the distribution

=head1 DESCRIPTION

If you don't want to wait for an official distribution, you can use
anonymous CVS to follow the latest Interchange.

B<WARNING:> There may be bugs introduced at any time! Thoroughly test
any changes before incorporating. Better yet, don't use CVS changes
for anything but fixing present bugs, and run the latest release.

=head1 USING THE CVS DISTRIBUTION

The basic steps are:

=head2 Check out from CVS

You need to have CVS installed on your system, to begin with. It comes
as a default on most free Unix-like systems if you selected the
development tools at install time.

If you are already an experienced CVS user, the information is:

	CVSROOT   :pserver:anon_cvs@cvs.akopia.com:/anon_cvs/repository
	password  anon_cvs
	module    interchange

If you are not experienced, it is still easy to get by following the
few steps below.

=item Set CVSROOT

Using bash/ksh/sh, type at the shell prompt:

	$ CVSROOT=:pserver:anon_cvs@cvs.akopia.com:/anon_cvs/repository
	$ export CVSROOT

If you use tcsh/csh, do:

	% setenv CVSROOT :pserver:anon_cvs@cvs.akopia.com:/anon_cvs/repository

=item Log in to CVS

Before you can check out from the server, log in:

	$ cvs login
	password: anon_cvs

=item Select a place to put it and check it out

Your home directory or more probably a src/ subdirectory:

	$ cd
	$ mkdir src
	$ cd src
	$ cvs checkout -P interchange

It will take a while -- if you are on a modem it may take quite a bit
of time, as there are several megabytes of files to download.

=head2 Make an installation tar file

If it is your first time installing Interchange from the CVS, you will want
to make a distribution tar file:

	$ cd interchange
	$ perl Makefile.PL nocopy
	Writing Makefile for Interchange
	$ make tardist
	/usr/local/bin/perl -I/YOUR/PERL/LIB -MExtUtils::Manifest=manicopy,maniread \
	-e "manicopy(maniread(),'interchange-4.6.1', 'best');"
	mkdir interchange-4.6.1
	mkdir interchange-4.6.1/dist
	....
	$ ls interch*
	interchange-4.6.1.tar.gz

=head2 Unpack and install

Unpack the tar file and install as is normal. See the README and QuickStart
files for help.

=head2 Checking for differences

If you want to see how your current image compares to the repository, log in
to CVS and run:

	cvs diff | more

=head2 Updating

To update the distribution, log into CVS as above, change to the distribution
directory (i.e. src/interchange), then run:

	$ cd $HOME/src/interchange
	$ cvs update
	U MANIFEST
	U WHATSNEW
	....

In many cases, the major differences in the distribution will be easily
updateable. You can copy any changed files directly to these
library directories:

	lib/Vend           (and all subdirectories)
	lib/UI             (and all subdirectories)

You should check the files:

	catalog_after.cfg     (infrequently updated)
	catalog_before.cfg    (frequently updated)
	interchange.cfg.dist  (infrequently updated)
	usertag/*             (infrequently updated)

Finally, you should check differences in the bin/* files. While they
are not as frequently updated as the lib/* files, they do change. Run
diffs against the source files in scripts/*.PL, or do another install
to a blank directory and do a diff to that.

=head2 Keeping the catalog in sync

If you are patterning your order methods after one of the template
catalogs, you will want to check the products/*.txt and products/*.asc
files for changes. In particular, mv_metadata.asc is used to format
and present quite a few things in the user interface. You may have
to merge the databases manually. In most cases, you can import them
into a spreadsheet or database.

=head1 Troubleshooting

Some problems can occur due to the CVS image being dynamic.

=head2 MANIFEST out of sync -- file not found

If you get a complaint that a "file is not found" when trying to do 
a C<make tardist> or C<make dist>, just do:

	rm MANIFEST
	make manifest

=head2 Trying to run from the CVS directory

If you install in the directory where your CVS image lives, you will have
problems.
