{MYSQL}mysqladmin create test_minivend
Since you selected the MySQL option, you need to create
a database named "minivend_test". In a default MySQL
configuration, any user may create and drop and modify
test_* databases, but some administrators disable this.
  

{PGSQL}createdb test_minivend
Since you selected the PostgreSQL option, you need to create
a database named "minivend_test". This will only work if
your administrator allowed it.
