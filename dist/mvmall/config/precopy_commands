{MYSQL}mysqladmin create test_simple
Since you selected the MySQL option, you need to create
a database named "test_simple". In a default MySQL
configuration, any user may create and drop and modify
test_* databases, but some administrators disable this.
  

{PGSQL}createdb test_simple
Since you selected the PostgreSQL option, you need to create

your administrator allowed it.
