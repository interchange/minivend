To use the catalog, search or select from window
below.  The results are displayed in the window
to the left.  When you see an item you like, you can
click
<FONT COLOR=RED><STRONG>More Details</STRONG></FONT>,
and it will show you the catalog page for the item.
<P>
If you decide to buy an item, just click on the
<FONT COLOR=RED><STRONG>Order</STRONG></FONT> link,
and a new window with the order form will appear.

If you want to shop some more, just leave
the order screen and continue shopping. When you order
additional items, they will automatically be added to
the order form.  When you are finished, fill in
your name and address, along with the way you want
the merchandise shipped. Your sales tax and shipping
cost will be calculated (you can click on
<FONT COLOR=RED><STRONG>Refresh</STRONG></FONT> to see it)
and the order will be entered in our system. You will receive
an email reply with the invoice, ship date, and an order
number to reference if you have questions.
