## Default: blank
#
# Specify a catalog to be run by this MiniVend server. The three
# required parameters are the name, the directory, and the script
# name that (the path vlink is named to) will run the catalog.
# Additional parameters are aliases for the catalog.
# 
# If FullUrl is enabled, you will need to set the full server
# and script path.
#
# This is a multiple directive -- the number of catalogs that
# can be defined is limited only by your machine resources.
#
# An old-style minivend.cfg will work for a standalone
# catalog.
#
# Catalog  sample /home/user/catalogs/sample /cgi-bin/sample /cgi-bin/alias


## Default: No
#
# Normally MiniVend determines which catalog to call by
# determining the SCRIPT_NAME from the CGI call. This means
# that different (and maybe virtual) hosts cannot use the
# same SCRIPT_NAME to call different catalogs. Set FullUrl
# to yes to differentiate based on the calling host.
# You must then set the server name in the Catalog
# directive accordingly, i.e. yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/sample.
#
# FullUrl


## Default: 4
#
# The number of servers that MiniVend will allow to
# serve requests simultaneously.  Set lower if you
# wish to conserve memory at all costs.
#
# MaxServers


## Default: 60
#
# How often (in seconds) MiniVend will wake up to look for
# user reconfiguration requests and check for hung processes.
#
# If you have a very lightly used server then you could set
# this to a high number to allow MiniVend to be swapped to
# disk more readily.
#
# HouseKeeping


## Default: No
#
# Controls whether program errors will be appended to the
# browser display.
#
# DisplayErrors


## Default: Yes
#
# Implements the domain/ip session qualifiers so that only the
# major domain is used to qualify the session ID.  This is a
# compromise on security, but it allows non-cookie-accepting
# browsers like AOL's V2.0 to use multiple proxy servers.
# 
# Default is yes, since most everyone wants AOL to work.
#
# DomainTail


## Default: blank
#
# Defines a F<global> subroutine for use by the B<[perl sub]
# subname arg [/perl]> construct.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: These global subroutines are NOT SUBJECT TO
# SECURITY CHECKS -- they can do most anything!  For most purposes,
# scratch subroutines or catalog subroutines are better.
#
# You may define as many as desired.
#
# GlobalSub


## Default: blank
#
# The name and arguments of an external program for checking page HTML.
#
#    CheckHTML  /usr/local/bin/weblint -s -
#
# Do not use redirection of I/O in this call. You will always receive
# stderr output. Activate on the page with [tag flag checkhtml][/tag]
# at the very top or very bottom.
#
# CheckHTML


## Default: No
#
# Implements the domain/ip session qualifiers so that only the
# first two dot-quads of the IP address are used to qualify the
# session ID.  This is a compromise on security, but it allows
# non-cookie-accepting browsers like AOL's V2.0 to use multiple
# proxy servers.
#
# DomainTail is preferable unless one of your HTTP servers does
# not do host name lookups.
# 
# Default is no, and DomainTail must be set to 'no' for it to
# operate.
#
# IpHead


## Default: 30
#
# The number of seconds after which a locked or running
# session could be considered to be lost due to malfunction.
#
# Controls the timeout for killing an apparently hung process,
# like a glimpse search, as well as the lock on a session.
# 
# If you don't have long-running searches or long-running database
# imports, consider setting this to 15 seconds or less. If you
# may have long-running searches, consider setting to 60 seconds.
# The default of 30 is probably a good bet for most catalogs.
#
# HammerLock


## Default: No
#
# Whether MiniVend will send cookies corresponding to only the CGI
# program in use.  Allows different stores in the same domain to each
# store separate cookie information -- affects cookie path.
#
# May be used to control other settings in the future.
#
# Mall


## Default: No
#
# Whether MiniVend [file ...] and other tags can read any file on
# the system. The default is to allow any file to be read -- this
# should be changed in a multi-user environment.
#
# NoAbsolute


## Default: 148 249
#
# Sets the codes that will be untrapped in the Safe.pm module,
# used for embedded Perl and conditional operations.  You can see
# the Safe.pm documentation by typing 'perldoc Safe' at the
# command prompt.  The default is '249 148' (or 'ftfile sort' if
# using Perl 5.004), which untraps the file existence test
# operator and the sort operator.  Define it as blank to not
# allow any besides the very restrictive Safe.pm defaults.
#
# SafeUntrap


## Default: Yes
#
# If your operating system does not have a re-entrant C library that
# can guarantee that signal race conditions will not occur, then
# set this to NO.
#
# BSDI and FreeBSD libraries are NOT safe, and SafeSignals will
# automatically be disabled for those operating systems.
#
# In general, if MiniVend ever just "hangs", particularly if you
# can see a perl.core file, disable this directive.
#
# SafeSignals


## Default: localhost
#
# The host(s) that will be allowed to generate MiniVend requests
# when running in INET mode.  You are responsible for security!
# Remember that socket communications are not necessarily secure
# when going over a wire!
#
# TcpHost


## Default: 7786
#
# The port that will be monitored for MiniVend requests
# when running in INET mode. 
#
# TcpPort


## Default: No
#
# Whether user-stimulated page builds are allowed.  If you don't
# have large user catalogs, should be no problem to enable.  But
# if there are multi-megabyte databases, could cause a huge
# performance problem.
#
# If allowed, pages will be built presuming the proper
# StaticAll/StaticPage setting is present and mv_build_static is
# set in the CGI values.
#
# UserBuild
