TAXAREA
.
For the US, this is usually the state(s) your business is
located in. Non-US users will probably have to set this
differently depending on their tax laws.

TAXRATE
.
For US users, this looks like STATE=RATE, where the rate
is in percent. The default below taxes Ohio at 6% and 
Illinois at 7.25 percent. More states can be added or
you can have only one. Should correspond to TAXAREA.

SOMESQL
.
Interchange has a workable internal database, but many things will
work better (and a few worse) if you use a SQL database. Interchange
can configure MySQL and Postgres in a test configuration.

MYSQL
.
You can select this to use MySQL in your test catalog. Careful!
This requires the ability to create a database named "test_construct",
and is highly dependent on your Perl and MySQL configuration. Don't
be too surprised if this doesn't work.

SQLCREATE
.
We can try and use mysqladmin to create the database in
MySQL. In many default Mysql distributions, any user can create
a database beginning with "test". 
.
Use the next option to add parameters. If your Mysql is password-protected
(and you know the password) you may want to add "-u root -p".

SQLCREATEOPT
.
To create the database you may need to supply a password and
username. To do that, add the option "-u USERNAME -p", where
USERNAME is a Mysql user with permission to create databases.
This is often the user "root".

PGSQL
.
You can select this to use PostGres in your test catalog.
This requires the ability to create a database named "test_construct",
and is highly dependent on your Perl and system configuration. Don't
be too surprised if this doesn't work.

MULTIORDER
.
Interchange can do order pages in any way; two examples are provided.
The default is single-page.

TEMPLATE
.
There are three color schemes available as an example of
how you might template catalogs. Select one of:
.
  brown1  blue1  yellow1

UPSADDER
.
For the UPS lookup, the standard UPS tables are normally
used. If you want to add a handling charge, do it here.

SUPERUSER
.
You can use Interchange's companion configuration
interface, to do upload/download of files, manipulation of
the database, reconfiguration of the catalog, and much more.
.
To enable the UI, you will need a "super-user" account
name that has full access.
.
The initial password is "pass". CHANGE IT! You can do this
by going to the admin menu and selecting the superuser and
then "Change password".
