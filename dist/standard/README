Thu May  1 15:08:29 EDT 2003 -- Initial alpha release

This is Mike Heins' modified foundation demo. Changes from the one distributed
with Interchange:

	* Virtually all buttons and menus are text-based so that you can
	  add menu entries, buttons, and translations for same without
	  making images.

	* All look/feel configuration is done by CSS. It should be quite
	  possible to completely change the look simply by editing
	  variables/THEME_CSS and include/layout/*.

    * There is only one color scheme (blueyellow) and no THEME/STYLE
	  variable. Therefore the regions/ directory is directly in 
	  templates.

	* The default for left-hand side is a product tree, for the top
	  bar is a flydown/out menu. Each are editable from within the UI.

	* The template layout is contained in include/layout/*, and
	  by [set display_class]leftonly[/set] you can change the type
	  within the page.

	* The page title, and page banner can be set anywhere before
	  the page footer.

	* There is an alternative multi-page checkout which has received
	  quite a bit of testing.

	* UPS lookup for Canada and the US is supported out of the
	  box.

    * US Postal international shipping is supported.

    * Customer service pages have been spiffed up and improved
	  a bit.

    * If you install Text::Query, the search boxes will use
	  Altavista-style search language.

	* Advanced search page improved quite a bit.

	* All shipping files/databases moved to products/ship

	* No more etc/after.cfg -- all configuration in catalog.cfg.

    * A few new feature demonstrations included.

	* Some files have been moved to unclutter the top level
	  of the pages/ directory.

    * More minor changes not mentioned here.

The intent is to slowly document each of the areas of this template with
online help to provide a constantly-improving catalog application for
use by Interchange users not wishing to greatly change the foundation.
