MYSQL
.
You can select this to use MySQL in your test catalog. Careful!
This requires the ability to create a database named "test_foundation",
and is highly dependent on your Perl and MySQL configuration. Don't
be too surprised if this doesn't work.

MYSQLCREATE
.
We can try and use mysqladmin to create the database in
MySQL. In many default MySQL distributions, any user can create
a database beginning with "test". 
.
Use the next option to add parameters. If your MySQL is password-protected
(and you know the password) you may want to add "-u root -p".

MYSQLCREATEOPT
.
To create the database you may need to supply a password and
username. To do that, add the option "-u USERNAME -p", where
USERNAME is a MySQL user with permission to create databases.
This is often the user "root".

PGSQL
.
You can select this to use PostgreSQL in your test catalog.
This requires the ability to create a database named "test_foundation",
and is highly dependent on your Perl and system configuration. Don't
be too surprised if this doesn't work.

SUPERUSER
.
You can use Interchange's companion configuration
interface, to do upload/download of files, manipulation of
the database, reconfiguration of the catalog, and much more.
.
To enable the UI, you will need a "super-user" account
name that has full access.
.
The initial password is "pass". CHANGE IT! You can do this
by going to the admin menu and selecting the superuser and
then "Change password".
