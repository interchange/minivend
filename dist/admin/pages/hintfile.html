SERVERNAME
The server base location for this catalog. It can be any of
<PRE>
     www.[value CATALOGNAME].com
     www.[value CATALOGNAME].com:8000
     www.yourisp.com/~[value CATALOGNAME]
</PRE>Or many variations.<BR>

DOCUMENTROOT
The base directory for HTML for this (possibly virtual) domain. Often
it is <TT>[value HOMEDIR]/www</TT>, <TT>[value HOMEDIR]/html</TT>, or
<TT>[value HOMEDIR]/public_html</TT>. 
<BR>

CGIDIR
The location of the normal CGI directory.
<P>
If all CGI programs must end in .cgi, it would
normally be the same as the HTML directory.
<BR>

CGIURL
The URL location of the CGI program, without the http://
or server name. Usually one of:
<PRE>
    /cgi-bin/[value CATALOGNAME]
    /[value CATALOGNAME].cgi
</PRE>
You may also define aliases that are essentially the same
in use; to use the internal HTTP server you must define
one of /[value CATALOGNAME].

IMAGEDIR
Where the image files should be copied. A directory path
name, not a URL. Put NONE in if you don't wish to copy images.
<BR>

SAMPLEHTML
Where the sample HTML files should be
installed. Usually a subdirectory of
your HTML directory.
<BR>

CATROOT
Where the MiniVend files for this catalog will go.
This should not be in the HTML directory!
The default usually works well.
<BR>

IMAGEURL
The URL base for the sample images. Sets the ImageDir
directive in the catalog configuration file. This is a URL
fragment, not a directory or file name. It would be something
like the bold portion of:
<PRE>
        <B>/[value CATALOGNAME]/images</B>/icon.gif
</PRE><BR>

HOMEDIR
The home directory to base everything out of if this is a
virtual domain.
