   MiniVend is a full-featured electronic catalog system (commonly known
   as a shopping cart) with online ordering capability. It is designed to
   provide an interface complete with SSL security and full database
   support.
   
   MiniVend is freely-redistributable under the GNU General Public
   License -- you can download it via FTP.

    MiniVend 3.0 Features

       * PGP support for secure off-site mailing of orders
       * Catalogs can be of almost unlimited size with excellent
         performance
       * Multi-server mode for very high capacity on systems with
         sufficient memory

         flexible catalog pages to be completely built from
         the database

    Flexible Ordering Process

There is a simple demo application included. 

To install the demo, go to the MiniVend installation directory
and run:

    bin/makecat simple

Follow the prompts and after restarting the MiniVend server you
should be able to access the demo catalogs.

MiniVend has been well-tested on Solaris 2, SunOS, Linux, HP-UX,
BSDI, FreeBSD, and OSF/Alpha. It also reportedly runs on SCO,
AIX, and other Unix ports.  It should work on any UNIX or Win32
OS with Perl 5.004 or higher.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR WINDOWS: MiniVend will NOT run with the early
ActiveState ports, otherwise known as 5.003 build 1XX. It REQUIRES, repeat
REQUIRES, the standard version Perl 5.004 or 5.005 ActiveState "merge"
ports. See http://www.perl.com/ for information on how to obtain it.

Windows does not support fork(), so the server runs in the foreground. You
need the DB_File module for best results, and that is not included in the
standard distribution. You can get it at http://www.perl.com/CPAN-local
(or any CPAN archive) in the ports/win32/Standard/x86/ directory.

WINDOWS INSTALLATION
--------------------

    Obtain the self-extracting executable minivend-3.14-2.exe
    and double-click on it. You MUST already have Perl 5.004
    INSTALLED and in your PATH.

    Alternatively, you can unzip the file yourself and run
    "setup".

UNIX INSTALLATION
------------------
Here is the short version:

    gzip -dc minivend-3.14-2.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd minivend-3.14-2
    ./configure

More information is in the file INSTALL.

-- WHEN IN DOUBT, RE-START THE SERVER.  It won't take but a few
   seconds, and changes in configurable options don't take effect
   until it is done. You may even change a page and not see the
   effect until the server is restarted.

The documentation is in 3 files in the doc/ subdirectory of
the main MiniVend directory:

       toc.html       Table of contents
       frtoc.html     Frames table of contents
       minivend.html  Main documentation file

These files will be copied to the same HTML directory as
the simple demo gateway files -- they would normally
be referenced as:

           http:/www.yourserver.com/simple/toc.html

There is an extended documentation package available
at www.minivend.com.

RedHat Linux 5.0:
        RedHat Linux 5.0 has a bad Perl distribution that causes
        problems with POSIX. The real solution is to obtain the
        latest.tar.gz file from CPAN and build a new Perl. Here
        is the script to do that once you have obtained the 
        latest.tar.gz file:

            tar xzf latest.tar.gz
            cd perl5.004*
            perl -pi.dist -e \
                "s:/ bsd / /:/ net / /' | sed -e 's/ bsd / c g /:; \
                s/^#(POSIX_cflags)/POSIX_cflags/" \
                hints/linux.sh
            ./Configure -des && make test

        That should get you a Perl which passes make test
        one hundred percent and that works with MiniVend and
        other programs which use the POSIX library. After
        you have verified the "make test" passes fully
        you should of course su to root and "make install".

        This may soon be corrected by the Perl porters or by
        RedHat, so bear in mind this is time-sensitive. The above
        works well as of Jun. 3, 1998.

IRIX, Solaris, Digital UNIX:
       The server may not terminate immediately,
       as the select() call blocks signals. It
       will stop at the next request, or at the
       end of the occasional houskeeping
       cycle, set by the directive HouseKeeping in
       minivend.cfg. Set to less than 10 to achieve
       decent response.

BSDI, FreeBSD:
       The BSDI library code is not safely re-entrant
       when used in combination with signals, so no
       signals are sent during server usage.  This is
       transparent to the user.

       MiniVend may not as of this writing work with
       BSDI 3.0 in UNIX mode, so you should use the INET
       mode and the tlink program. This is the catalog
       configurator default.

       If the kernel parameter CHILD_MAX is not configured
       above the default of 40, expect problems. Same with
       SO_MAXCONN and some other kernel parameters. 

Solaris:
       If you are trying to run with Perl 5.003, which is
       NOT recommended, you must use the File::Lock
       module -- flock() emulation in Perl 5.003 does not
       work properly, and fcntl() locking must be used.
       This version of MiniVend includes File::Lock,
       and attempts to install it.

       Solaris 2.4 has problems with UNIX-domain sockets
       and you can expect problems.  Bottom line is that
       I will not support Solaris releases before 2.5, nor
       Perl before 5.004.

       You may not use OrderCounter when running Perl
       5.003 and Solaris.

       If you have Perl 5.004 you can disregard File::Lock.

       It is STRONGLY RECOMMENDED that you update to Perl 5.004
       when running on Solaris.

Windows:
       Just a few things don't work the same as UNIX. See the
       README-win.txt file for more information.

---------------------------------------------------------------------

I, the author, am very interested in learning your problems with
MiniVend, and am interested in clarifying the documentation for
future improvements.  I am not much interested in BEING your
documentation, though, unless you pay well and promptly. Please
send kudos, comments, questions, and complaints to:

       mikeh@minivend.com

Note that I receive thousands of emailed questions per year and cannot
answer them all. The more research you do on your own the more likely
I am to respond. Helpful suggestions and real bug reports are almost
always acknowledged.

Good luck with MiniVend!
