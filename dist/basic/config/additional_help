LOGO
 
This can be an absolute image URL, or can be just a file
name that will go in your image directory. That directory
should be __MVC_IMAGEDIR__.

TAXAREA
 
For the US, this is usually the state(s) your business is
located in. Non-US users will probably have to set this
differently depending on their tax laws.

TAXRATE
  
For US users, this looks like STATE=RATE, where the rate
is in percent. The default below taxes Ohio at 6% and 
Illinois at 7.25 percent. More states can be added or
you can have only one. Should correspond to TAXAREA.

TAXSHIPPING
  
If your state charges salestax on shipping, then enter
the state code. (Again, Non-US users will have this vary
based on their locale.)

UPSADDER
  
For the UPS lookup, the standard UPS tables are normally
used. If you want to add a handling charge, do it here.

SUPERUSER
  
You can use MiniMate, MiniVend's companion configuration
interface, to do upload/download of files, manipulation of
the database, reconfiguration of the catalog, and much more.
   
To enable MiniMate, you will need a "super-user" account
name that has full access.
