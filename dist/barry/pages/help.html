<!-- ----- Main text of page ----- -->
If this were a real store, this is where we would attempt to plae idiot-proof
instructions regarding the use of our site.  This wouldn't be due to any
personal interest in you as a customer, but rather as a way of saving
us money.  Hey!  If you can figure it out, you don't have to call us, right?
<p>
If this were a real store, that is.  But since it's just a demo store, we
can put some sort of syrupy message that will probably not be helpful, but
will leave you feeling warm and fuzzy.
