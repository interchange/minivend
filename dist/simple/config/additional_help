LOGO
 
This can be an absolute image URL, or can be just a file
name that will go in your image directory. That directory
should be __MVC_SAMPLEHTML__/images.

SMLOGO
 
This can be an absolute image URL, or can be just a file
name that will go in your image directory. That directory
should be __MVC_SAMPLEHTML__/images.

HEADERBG
 
This will be used to set the background color for the
header bars in the shopping cart and checkout display,
as well as any other title bars.

TABLEFG
 
This will be used to set the background color for the
tables in the sidebar menu sections.

HEADERTEXT
 
This will be used to set the text color within the title
bars in cart and checkout display, as well as any other
title bars.

TAXAREA
 
For the US, this is usually the state(s) your business is
located in. Non-US users will probably have to set this
differently depending on their tax laws.

TAXRATE
 
For US users, this looks like STATE=RATE, where the rate
is in percent. The default below taxes Ohio at 6% and 
Illinois at 7.25 percent. More states can be added or
you can have only one. Should correspond to TAXAREA.

TAXSHIPPING
 
If your state charges salestax on shipping, then enter
the state code. (Again, Non-US users will have this vary
based on their locale.)

UPSADDER
 
For the UPS lookup, the standard UPS tables are normally
used. If you want to add a handling charge, do it here.

SUPERUSER
 
You can use MiniVend's access control to allow upload and
download of files and reconfiguration of the catalog. You
log in just like a normal user, but when the account name
matches this value then you get access to the "reconfig"
directory where the control is.

NOCRYPT
  
If you leave this blank, passwords will be encrypted in the user
database. If you set this to anything other than zero or a blank
value, passwords will not be encrypted and will be readable in
the user database. Encrypted is recommended, but be sure to write
down your password.

SUPASSWD
 
Don't lose this! If you have crypt set up for UserDB, then
you may not be able to see what it is. You can always temporarily
set MV_NO_CRYPT to 1, and see what it is by exporting the
user database.
  
Shown below is the default password:

in encrypted form.
