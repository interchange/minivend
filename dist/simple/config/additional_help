LOGO
.
This can be an absolute image URL, or can be just a file
name that will go in your image directory. That directory
should be /home/mickey/www/simple/images.

TAXAREA
.
For the US, this is usually the state(s) your business is
located in. Non-US users will probably have to set this
differently depending on their tax laws.

TAXRATE
.
For US users, this looks like STATE=RATE, where the rate
is in percent. The default below taxes Ohio at 6% and 
Illinois at 7.25 percent. More states can be added or
you can have only one. Should correspond to TAXAREA.

SOMESQL
.
Interchange has a workable internal database, but many things will
work better (and a few worse) if you use a SQL database. Interchange
can configure MySQL and Postgres in a test configuration.

MYSQL
.
You can select this to use MySQL in your test catalog. Careful!
This requires the ability to create a database named "test_simple",
and is highly dependent on your Perl and MySQL configuration. Don't
be too surprised if this doesn't work.

PGSQL
.
You can select this to use PostGres in your test catalog.
This requires the ability to create a database named "test_simple",
and is highly dependent on your Perl and system configuration. Don't
be too surprised if this doesn't work.

TAXSHIPPING
.
If your state charges salestax on shipping, then enter
the state code. (Again, Non-US users will have this vary
based on their locale.)

MULTIORDER
.
Interchange can do order pages in any way; two examples are provided.
The default is single-page.

TEMPLATE
.
There are three color schemes available as an example of
how you might template catalogs. Select one of:
.
  brown1  blue1  yellow1

UPSADDER
.
For the UPS lookup, the standard UPS tables are normally
used. If you want to add a handling charge, do it here.

SUPERUSER
.
You can use Interchange's companion configuration interface to
do upload/download of files, manipulation of the database,
reconfiguration of the catalog, and much more.
.
To enable the admin interface, you will need a "super-user"
account name that has full access.

NOCRYPT
.
If you set this to 0, passwords will be encrypted in the user
database. If you set this to anything other than zero or a blank
value, passwords will not be encrypted and will be readable in
the user database. You can build encrypted passwords with
the htpasswd command, or other means.
.
Don't expect to be able to email out forgotten passwords if you
set encryption. 8-)
.
You can use your up arrow to look at the encrypted form of
"pass" if you have Term::ReadLine installed.

SUPASSWD
.
You can use Interchange's companion configuration
interface, to do upload/download of files, manipulation of
the database, reconfiguration of the catalog, and much more.
.
To enable the UI, you will need a "super-user" account
name that has full access.
.
The initial password is "pass". CHANGE IT! You can do this
by going to the admin menu and selecting the superuser and
then "Change password".
