<H1>MiniVend Tech Tip No. 5</H1>
<P>
MiniVend has been tested on <I>Linux</I>, <I>FreeBSD</I>, <I>OSF/1</I>,
<I>Solaris 2</I>, and <I>SunOS</I>. If you successfully install and run
it on another operating system, please <A HREF="mailto:support@minivend.com">
let us know</A> . The base server should
be very portable -- and quite reliable. Robustness is much improved for
MiniVend 2.0. If you have any problems with the program, please let me
know that too. The goal is to make MiniVend run on any UNIX with Perl 5.
