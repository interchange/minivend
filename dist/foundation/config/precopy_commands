{MYSQL}mysqladmin -u __MVC_SQLUSER__ -p__MVC_SQLPASS__ create __MVC_SQLDB__
Since you selected the MySQL option, you need to create a database named
"__MVC_SQLDB__". In a default MySQL configuration, any user may create
and drop and modify test_* databases, but some administrators disable this.
  

{PGSQL}createdb __MVC_SQLDB__
Since you selected the PostgreSQL option, you need to create a database named
"__MVC_SQLDB__". This will only work if your administrator allowed it.
