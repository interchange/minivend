Using the new SysV-style catalog configuration
----------------------------------------------

Similar to Unix System V initialization, we've added infrastructure to the
Foundation catalog to allow small configuration snippets to be turned on or
off, or additions, removals, and upgrades to be made. This makes it possible
to upgrade a live catalog without worrying so much about customizations made
to catalog.cfg.

This works by putting symbolic links into a directory called rc.d, which
point to the real config snippets in init.d. The symlinks' filenames begin
with S followed by a two-digit number, so you can control which order they
run in.

To get going, just erase catalog.cfg and put in it only the following line:

include config/rc.d/S*

Then do the following (making the obvious replacements):

ls -1 CATROOT/config/init.d/*.cfg | xargs VENDROOT/bin/chkcat CATNAME --on

This will enable *all* the config snippets, which will probably cause some
trouble, since you're not likely using Oracle, PostgreSQL, MySQL, and DBM
all at the same time. Disable what you're not using like this:

VENDROOT/bin/chkcat CATNAME --off mysql oracle pgsql taxing_simple taxing_vat local

You should then be able to restart Interchange and use the catalog.

To see what's on and what's off, do:

VENDROOT/bin/chkcat CATNAME --list

Currently there's no checking for dependencies or conflicts, but you'll
notice first attempts in the comments of some of the files.

I'm probably forgetting a number of things.
