## Default: blank
#
# Specify a catalog to be run by this MiniVend server. The three required
# parameters are the name, the directory, and the script name that
# (the path vlink is named to) will run the catalog. Additional
# parameters are aliases for the catalog.
# 
# If FullUrl is enabled, you will need to set the full server
# and script path.
#
# This is a multiple directive -- the number of catalogs that
# can be defined is limited only by your machine resources.
#
# An old-style minivend.cfg will work for a standalone
# catalog.
#
# Catalog  sample /home/user/catalogs/sample /cgi-bin/sample /cgi-bin/alias


## Default: No
#
# Normally MiniVend determines which catalog to call by
# determining the SCRIPT_NAME from the CGI call. This means
# that different (and maybe virtual) hosts cannot use the
# same SCRIPT_NAME to call different catalogs. Set FullUrl
# to yes to differentiate based on the calling host.
#
# FullUrl


## Default: webmaster
#
# An email address to mail special and server errors to.
# The address 'nobody' is usually safe if you don't want mail.
#
# MailErrorTo


## Default: 2
#
# The number of servers that MiniVend will allow to
# serve requests simultaneously.  Replaces ForkSearches
# and MultiServer mode.
#
# MaxServers


## Default: 60
#
# How often (in seconds) MiniVend will wake up to look for
# user reconfiguration requests and check for hung processes.
#
# If you have a very lightly used server then you could set
# this to a high number to allow MiniVend to be swapped to
# disk more readily.
#
# HouseKeeping


## Default: No
#
# Controls whether program errors will be appended to the
# browser display.
#
# DisplayErrors


## Default: 30
#
# The number of seconds after which a locked session could be
# considered to be lost due to malfunction. This will kill the
# lock on the session. Only here for monitoring of session
# handoff, if this error shows up in the error log the system
# setup should be examined.
#
# HammerLock


## Default: 148 249
#
# Sets the codes that will be untrapped in the Safe.pm module, used for
# embedded Perl and conditional operations.  You can see the Safe.pm
# documentation by typing 'perldoc Safe' at the command prompt.  The
# default is '249 148' (or 'ftfile sort' if using Perl 5.004), which
# untraps the file existence test operator and the sort operator.
# Define it as blank to not allow any besides the very restrictive
# Safe.pm defaults.
#
# SafeUntrap


## Default: localhost
#
# The host(s) that will be allowed to generate MiniVend requests
# when running in INET mode.  You are responsible for security!
# Remember that socket communications are not necessarily secure
# when going over a wire!
#
# TcpHost


## Default: 7786
#
# The port that will be monitored for MiniVend requests
# when running in INET mode. 
#
# TcpPort


## Default: No
#
# Whether user-stimulated page builds are allowed.  If you don't have
# large user catalogs, should be no problem to enable.  But if there
# are multi-megabyte databases, could cause a huge performance problem.
#
# If allowed, pages will be built presuming the proper StaticAll/StaticPage
# setting is present and mv_build_static is set in the CGI values.
#
# UserBuild


## Default: Yes
#
# Whether MiniVend [file ...] and other tags can read any file on
# the system. The default is to constrain the checks to subdirectories
# of the catalog directory.
#
# NoAbsolute


## Default: blank
#
# Defines a F<global> subroutine for use by the B<[perl sub] subname arg [/perl]>
# construct.
#
# IMPORTANT NOTE: These global subroutines are NOT SUBJECT TO
# SECURITY CHECKS -- they can do most anything!  For most purposes,
# scratch subroutines or catalog subroutines are better.
#
# You may define as many as desired.
#
# GlobalSub
