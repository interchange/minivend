<H1>MiniVend Tech Tip No. 4</H1>
<P>
The features using conditional logic and embedded Perl are safe, 
not only because they use the <B>Safe</B> module.  MiniVend pages
are <I>not located in regular document space</I>, but in MiniVend's
own directory.  They should be readable only by MiniVend -- don't
place them in your HTML document space.
