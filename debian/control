Description: Foundation Store, a sample Interchange catalog
 The Foundation store is a demo catalog which you can use to
 build your Interchange applications from. While the Foundation store
 is designed to be relatively easy to start with, it is still a full-featured
 demonstration of a number of Interchange capabilities. 
 Once you understand the Foundation store and how it works you are well 
 on your way to understanding the Interchange software.

Description: e-commerce and general HTTP database display system
 Interchange is a database access and retrieval system focused on e-commerce.
 It allows customers to select items to buy from catalog pages. The program
 tracks user information in sessions and interacts with a HTTP server
 through sockets.

Package: libapache-mod-interchange
Architecture: any
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, apache-common (>= ${THISDEV})
Suggests: interchange (>=4.8.1)
Description: Integration of the Interchange link protocol with Apache
 mod_interchange is designed to replace the vlink and tlink programs that
 come with Interchange. The Interchange link protocol is implemented via
 an Apache module which saves us the (small) overhead of the execution
 of a CGI program.
