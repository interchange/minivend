To reduce memory consumption for MiniVend, you can autoload some
routines, and remove some modules from the source.

IMPORTANT NOTE: Autoloading will only work with Perl
                version 5.003_93 and above.

Perform the following commands *from the MiniVend software directory*.

	bin/ifdef -y lib/Vend/*.pm
	bin/autosplit lib/Vend/*.pm

If you are not planning on using the new parsed page syntax, you can
save more memory:

	bin/ifdef -n -t NEWTAGS lib/Vend/Interpolate.pm

If you are not planning on using the static page building capability
of MiniVend, you can do:

	bin/ifdef -n -t STATICPAGE minivend.pl lib/Vend/Interpolate.pm lib/Vend/Parse.pm

If you are not planning on using the Glimpse search capability
of MiniVend, you can do:

	bin/ifdef -n -t GLIMPSE minivend.pl

To reverse the process on any of the above, change the sense of
'-y' to '-n' and vice versa.
