MiniVend - WWW Catalog Ordering

%%%
2
%%
VERSION
%%

This document describes MiniVend 1.03, based on Andrew Wilcox's
original Vend, Version 0.2.


%%%

%%
DESCRIPTION
%%

MiniVend allows customers to select items to buy from catalog pages. The
program tracks which products they have selected and the quantity
desired. From the ordering page they may complete the ordering process
by entering their name and address, or return to browsing and select
more items.

MiniVend plugs into a system with an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) server,
allowing encrypted transmission of sensitive customer data.  This
capability makes the entry of credit card numbers practical and secure.

With V1.03, multiple servers can now be started to serve the same
catalog, and searches are forked. This ensures fast response while searching
the catalog.

How MiniVend Manages Sessions
%%

Normally, each request for a World Wide Web page which comes in to a
server stands on its own. While the server will probably know which
machine a request comes from, it may not know if the next request
comes from the same browser or even from the same user on that
machine.

MiniVend keeps track of who is ordering what by including in the URL a
session id: a random string which is different for each customer
browsing the catalog.

So that the session id can be included in URL's within catalog pages,
every page in the catalog is served up by MiniVend running as a cgi-bin
program. Here is an example of such a URL:

    http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1

machine.company.com
    Internet address of server

cgi-bin
    Informs server that the requested page will be generated by a
    program.

vlink
    Name of the program to run

shirts
    Page of the catalog to display

WehUkATn;;1
    The session id


As of Version 1.03, MiniVend now optionally supports Cookies, which
allows interspersal of regular HTML references and MiniVend page
references.

Catalog pages are written in regular HTML with extensions to
support catalog ordering. Pages are delivered through the following
steps:

    1.  The HTTPD server receives a request for a catalog page.

    2a. The server is already running as a daemon, and the request
    causes a small C program called vlink.  The vlink program
    communicates with the MiniVend program
    via a UNIX-domain socket. 

           -- OR --

    2b. The server runs svend as a cgi-bin program. svend is a small C
    program which is setuid to the account which owns the catalog
    files. svend executes the MiniVend Perl script minivend.pl.
    THIS IS MUCH SLOWER than 2a.

    3.  MiniVend reads the HTML source page from the catalog pages directory,
    and interprets the catalog ordering extensions in the file. If the 
    page doesn't exist, and corresponds to a part number in the database,
    it is built "on the fly" using the template page flypage.html.

    4.  The page, which is now entirely in regular HTML, is delivered to
    the HTTPD server, which returns it to the browser.

Once the customer has finished, the completed order is emailed to the
vendor.

Where to Download MiniVend
%%

The MiniVend version described in this document is available from:

    http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/download.html

If you are on a Solaris, Irix (SGI), or other UNIX which does not have
native and complete flock() support, you must also obtain the File::Lock
module at the same place that Perl is available from.


%%%

%%
Perl
%%

You will probably need Perl version 5.002 to run MiniVend 1.03. Many sites
are still running lower Perl versions. In addition, on systems that do not
have GDBM or DB_File installed, some of MiniVend's features (notably
DBM order and page access tracking) will not be available. Large catalogs
may be impossible to run due to memory limitations.

You can download a copy of Perl 5 from any CPAN (Comprehensive Perl

Setup for the CERN HTTPD Server
%%

MiniVend uses the user and machine name of the customer as an additional
mechanism for distinguishing between users. Turn identity checking on
in the HTTPD server with the IdentityCheck directive:

    IdentityCheck  On

Unless changed by the UserId directive, the CERN httpd server will run
programs as the user "nobody". To ensure that vlink or svend is only run as a
cgi-bin program and not by other users on the system, svend will only
run under this user account. If other programs on the system use the
nobody account, you may want to change the UserId to an account which
is only used by httpd.

    UserId  hguest

You will also need rules to map URLs to your public HTML files and
your cgi-bin directory. These may be already set up in the httpd
configuration file. Here is an example:

    Exec  /xyzcorp/cgi-bin/*  /home/xyzcorp/cgi-bin/*
    Pass  /xyzcorp/*          /home/xyzcorp/WWW/*

The first line specifies that a URL such as
"http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/svend" will run the program svend
located in the /home/xyzcorp/cgi-bin directory. The second line
specifies that files in the /home/xyzcorp/WWW directory can be
retrieved with a URL such as http://machine.com/xyzcorp/file.

The mapping described by Exec will always require two parts in the
URL: one to specify the cgi-bin directory and another to specify the
program to run. You can shorten the URL by specifying an additional
mapping such as:

    Map  /catalog/*  /xyzcorp/cgi-bin/svend/*

This will allow a URL such as "http://machine.com/catalog/shirts" to
be used.

In the MiniVend configuration file, minivend.cfg, set the VendURL directive
to the URL which runs svend in the cgi-bin directory.

    VendURL  http://machine.company.com/catalog


%%%
14
%%
Setup for the NCSA and Apache Servers
%%

There is no special configuration required unless you plan
on running the MAT administration program.  Simply put
vlink or svend in the cgi-bin directory (of course it must be 
script-aliased), and run the MiniVend program.

If the MAT program is to be installed in a protected CGI directory, you must: 

1. Create the directory definition in the srm.conf file. This is
what the entry should look like (if you are using the default
NCSA/Apache installation directories):

    ScriptAlias /prot-bin/   /usr/local/etc/httpd/prot-bin/

2. Actually make the directory if it doesn't exist:

    mkdir /usr/local/etc/httpd/prot-bin

3. Add the following entry to the access.conf file:

    &lt;Directory /usr/local/etc/httpd/prot-bin>
    Options
    AuthUserFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/.htpasswd
    AuthGroupFile /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/.htgroup
    AuthName admin
    AuthType Basic
    &lt;Limit GET POST>
    require group admin
    &lt;/Limit>
    &lt;/Directory>

4. Create the password file with htpasswd or the like. For convenience,
a Perl version of htpasswd (htpasswd.pl) may be included in your bin/
directory. Copy the password file to /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/.htpasswd.

5. Create the /usr/local/etc/httpd/conf/.htgroup file with the
user name(s) to use in the file:
     
    admin:mike

6. Copy the mat executable to the protected bin directory.

7. Restart the HTTP server (send it a HUP signal), so it will re-read
the configuration files.

8. Test by accessing the URL http://machine.company.com/prot-bin/mat -- you
should be prompted for a password.


%%%

%%
QUICK START
%%

Before you begin, select the directory where you want to install MiniVend.
You can unpack the tar file either there, or in another temporary
directory -- the configure script handles either. The suggested
directory is /usr/local/lib/minivend -- but really any directory will
do.  You must of course have write permission there; and you will
eventually need to have write permission on your CGI-BIN and protected
CGI-BIN directories.

Decompress and untar the distribution:

    gzip -d mvend103.tar.gz
    tar xfv mvend103.tar

If you have GNU tar, you can combine these steps:

    tar xfvz mvend103.tar.gz

Before installing, check the site where you obtained MiniVend for any
patches that might have been issued since the release.

Run the configure script with:

    ./configure

If you have trouble with ./configure, try this:

    perl configure.pl /usr/bin/perl

Replace the 'perl' and '/usr/bin/perl' with the proper paths to
your Perl 5 binary.

The process should be self-explanatory. If you discover any problems,
refer to the following section, MANUAL INSTALLATION. Otherwise,
MiniVend should be installed at the completion of the script.  It is
suggested that you install the demo as a starting point for your own
catalog -- the configuration script will give you the opportunity to do
so.

IMPORTANT NOTE: One point that is to be emphasized --
only your base html pages go in the document space of your http server.
Any pages with MiniVend elements/tags go in the directory set by the
PageDir directive (the default is VendRoot/pages). For the demos
supplied with MiniVend, this means that only a few pages will be copied
to your HTTP server's DocumentRoot, with the remainder of the pages
staying in the directory defined as PageDir (sample or simple, depending
on the demo selected).


%%%
16
%%
If something goes wrong
%%
First, check the FAQ and bug list at the official MiniVend web site for 
information:
<A HREF="http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/bugreport.html">
http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/mvend.html </A>

Second, double check that you have the following things:

1. The vlink program is SUID, or you have made appropriate
changes in the ReadPermission and WritePermission directives.

2. That you have not made anything owned by root, and that
you have not started the server as root.

3. The vlink CGI program is being executed on a machine that has the
socket file etc/socket on a directly attached disk. UNIX-domain
sockets will not work on NFS-mounted filesystems!  That means the
server minivend.pl and the CGI program vlink must be executing
on the same machine.

If you have a problem you are not able to correct, you can send email
to:

<mikeh@iac.net>

Please include your operating system name and version, your
Perl version the DBM library in use, and a directory listing of the
MiniVend directory (and its etc directory) after the attempt to
run.  This can be done by  leaving a message at the MiniVend bug
reporting station:
<A HREF="http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/bugreport.html">
    http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/bugreport.html </A>

MiniVend is an ambitious and complex program, and is not presented as
being easy to use, easy to install, or bug-free.  The
configuration script was done to try and make a very painful process
only slightly painful.  Some people install in one pass.  Others never
make it, especially when they are running on an ISP.  Determined and
thoughtful users almost always make MiniVend work.


%%%
17
%%
MANUAL INSTALLATION
%%

NOTE: The manual installation procedure is not completely up to date.
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you use the configure script.

The MiniVend installation is complex, and requires quite a few distinct
steps.  That is why there is an interactive configuration script that
is included with MiniVend -- it merely does automatically
what is described below. It makes the process much easier, and will
install the demo catalog. This configuration script has been tested
on some, but not all, UNIX systems.  Please report problems
to &lt;mikeh@iac.net>.


%%%
18
%%
Needed Directories
%%

The MiniVend program, your catalog pages, and the products file should all
go into a private directory. Because the catalog pages are served
through the MiniVend cgi-bin program and contain nonstandard elements,
they should not be put into a public WWW directory, nor do they need
to have world-readable file permissions.

You will want a public WWW directory for inline image graphic files. MiniVend
does not serve the images, only the HTML tags calling them. A useful
convention is to place all buttonbars, backgrounds, and icons in
the /images directory, with the catalog items perhaps located
in the /images/catalog directory.  It is up to you, but remember
that you must use an absolute path -- relative paths will not do.

You will need a cgi-bin directory in which to put the svend program.

If using MAT, you will want a password-protected
private cgi-bin directory. See the section
Setting up the NCSA/Apache Server for details.


%%%
19
%%
Unpacking the Distribution
%%

Select a directory to use as your MiniVend base directory (referred to
hereafter as VendRoot).  Decompress and untar the distribution:

    gzip -d mvend102.tar.gz
    tar xfv mvend102.tar

If you have GNU tar, you can combine these steps:

    tar xfvz mvend102.tar.gz


%%%
20
%%
The Demo Systems
%%

The products directory contains a sample product file and the file
report in the main directory is the sample order report.  Sample catalog
pages are in the directories sample/ and simple/. If you would like to
use them as a starting point for your own catalog, you can either have
the configure script install the demo for you, or you can copy the
sample files into the MiniVend directory and your HTML directory, which
for these examples is assumed to be /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs.

To install the full-featured demo:

 cd /usr/minivend                   # wherever your vend directory is
 mkdir pages                        # make if not already there
 cp sample/*.html pages
 mkdir /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample  # or your document root
 mkdir /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample/images
 cp sample/images/* /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample/images
 cp sample/special*.html /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample
 cp sample/index.html  /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample
 cp sample/intro.html  /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample
 cp sample/address.html /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample

To install the simple demo:

 cd /usr/minivend                   # wherever your vend directory is
 mkdir pages                        # make if not already there
 cp simple/*.html pages
 mkdir /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample  # or your document root
 mkdir /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample/images
 cp sample/images/* /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample/images
 cp simple/index.html  /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample


%%%
21
%%
Testing Your CGI-BIN Directory
%%

This is a good time to test your cgi-bin configuration and find out
the numeric user-id which your HTTPD server runs cgi-bin programs
under. Edit "src/testcgi" and change the first line to refer to your Perl
version 5 (or higher) executable.

    #!/usr/bin/perl

Copy "testcgi" into your cgi-bin directory, and make it executable.

    cp src/testcgi /your/cgi-bin/directory
    chmod a+rx /your/cgi-bin/directory/testcgi

Try running testcgi from your shell command line to make sure that
everything is working.

    /your/cgi-bin/directory/testcgi

testcgi should respond with the version of Perl that you are running
and your numeric user id.

Now try running testcgi from your browser. Write down the numeric user
id which you get there, as you will need it later for svend and mat.


%%%
22
%%
Setting up SVEND
%%

svend is a small C program which is setuid to the user account which
can access the catalog data files. The following defines at the
beginning of svend.c should be set:



%%%
DIR-23
%%
CGIUSER
%%

Set this to the numeric uid (user id) which HTTPD runs cgi-bin
programs under. Typically this will be 'http', 'nobody' or 'guest'.


%%%
DIR-24
%%
PERL
%%

Set this to the location of the perl (version 5 or higher)
executable.


%%%
DIR-25
%%
VEND
%%

Set to the location of minivend.pl, typically in the VendRoot
directory.


Compile svend.c with your C compiler:

    cc svend.c -o svend

On some systems you can make the executable smaller with the strip
program. But don't worry about it if strip is not on your system.

    strip svend

If you want MiniVend to run under a different user account than your own,
make that user the owner of svend. (You probably need to be root to do
this). Do not make svend owned by root, because making svend setuid
root is an unnecessary security risk.

    chown vendacct svend

Make svend setuid:

    chmod u+s svend

Move the svend executable to your cgi-bin directory:

    mv svend /the/cgi-bin/directory



%%%
26
%%
Setting up VLINK
%%

The vlink program, compiled from link.c, is a small C program
which is setuid to the user account which can access the catalog data
files, and contacts a running MiniVend daemon. If the MiniVend daemon,
is not running, it will attempt to start it. The following defines at the
beginning of link.c should be set:



%%%
DIR-27
%%
LINK_FILE
%%

Set this to the name of the socket file that will be used
for configuration, usually "/usr/local/lib/minivend/etc/socket"
or the "etc/socket" under the directory you chose for the
VendRoot.


%%%
DIR-28
%%
LINK_TIMEOUT
%%

Set this to the number of seconds vlink should wait before announcing
that the MiniVend server is not running.  The default of 20 is probably
a reasonable value.


%%%
DIR-29
%%
NET_START
%%

If you want the vlink program to start the server for you if it
is not already running, set NET_START equal to "-netstart". If
you set it to the default of "-notify", it will send email to
the MailOrderTo address announcing that the MiniVend server
is down.  If you set it to anything else, it will just send
an innocuous message that "we are probably doing development".

NOTE: If you are running with the CreditCards directive
enabled, you will not be able to enter the password. The CreditCards
directive is disabled by default if -netstart is used to
start up MiniVend.


%%%
DIR-30
%%
PERL
%%

Set this to the location of the perl (version 5 or higher)
executable.


%%%
DIR-31
%%
VEND
%%

Set to the location of minivend.pl, typically in the VendRoot
directory.


Change directories to the src directory, then run the GNU
configure script:

    cd src
    ./configure

You will see some output as the configure script checks your system.
Then compile the program:

    cc link.c -o vlink

On some systems you can make the executable smaller with the strip
program. But don't worry about it if strip is not on your system.

    strip vlink

If you want MiniVend to run under a different user account than your own,
make that user the owner of vlink. (You probably need to be root to do
this). Do not make vlink owned by root, because making vlink setuid
root is an unnecessary security risk.

    chown vendacct vlink

Make vlink setuid:

    chmod u+s vlink

Move the vlink executable to your cgi-bin directory:

    mv svend /the/cgi-bin/directory

Some systems unset the SUID bit when moving the file -- re-set it
if necessary.


%%%
32
%%
Setting up minivend.pl
%%

Edit minivend.pl and specify the root directory which contains the MiniVend
distribution, along with the other needed paths:

    $Config::VendRoot = '/usr/local/lib/minivend';
    $Config::ConfDir = '/usr/local/lib/minivend/etc';
    $Config::PERL = '/usr/bin/perl';
    $Config::VEND = '/usr/local/lib/minivend/minivend.pl';

If you have the Des library and Perl Des module, uncomment the line:

        use Des;

That will allow internal encryption of credit card numbers stored on
disk.


%%%
33
%%
SETTING UP YOUR CATALOG
%%

MiniVend uses its own tags to implement catalog functions -- they
are similar to normal HTML, but are in &#91;square brackets&#93;.  They
will be referred to as either tags or elements in this document.
The next section describes how to set up the pages and the configuration
directives to make your own catalog.  The demo catalog is a good
starting point -- in particular we suggest you pay attention to the
order and search pages.

NOTE: If you are upgrading from MiniVend 1.01, you will have to
add the following line to the beginning of your products.asc
file:

code    description   price   link

The words should be separated by one of the approved delimiting schemes
(TAB, PIPE, or CSV, set with the Delimiter directive), and are
case-sensitve. If you play with the case of the "description" or "price"
field, you will have to appropriately set the PriceField and
DescriptionField directives.


%%%
34
%%
products.asc
%%

Each product you are selling should be given a product code: a short
code that identifies the product on the ordering page and in the
catalog. You can use any combination of letters, digits, dashes, periods,
pound signs, or underscores for the
product code. The products.asc file is a ASCII-delimited
list of all the product codes, along with an arbitrary number of fields
which must contain at least the fields 'description' and 'price' (or
whatever you set the PriceField and DescriptionField directives to).
Any additional information you want in the catalog can be placed in
any arbitrary field.

Three delimiter schemes are provided as standard:

    TAB     Fields separated by ^I characters
    
    code    description             price   image
    SH543   Men's fine cotton shirt 14.95   shirts.jpg
    
    
    PIPE    Fields separated by | characters
    
    code|description|price|image
    SH543|Men's fine cotton shirt|14.95|shirts.jpg
    
    
    CSV     Fields enclosed in quotes, separated by commas
    
    "code", "description", "price", "image"
    "SH543", "Men's fine cotton shirt", "14.95", "shirts.jpg"

The Delimiter directive sets the scheme, and should be set
to one of those three values.  TAB is the default scheme.

Field names are case-sensitve. Unless you have fields with the names
"description" and "price" field, you will have to appropriately set the
PriceField and DescriptionField directives to use the &#91;item-price&#93;
and &#91;item-description&#93; tags.

The product code must be the first field in the line.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The items must be separated by a single delimiter
character. The items are lined up for your reading convenience.

This version of MiniVend implements the database in either GDBM,
DB_File, or in-memory format. If you use DBM, large catalogs can be used
without using too much memory; or slowing down performance in static
mode.  The DBM files are built automatically at MiniVend startup from
the products file -- if it has not changed they are not built. If the
only DBM type on your system is NDBM, an in-memory product database will
be used. Catalogs of more than, say, 5,000 items will use large amounts
of memory.

IMPORTANT NOTE: The field names must be on the first line of the
products.asc file. These field names must match exactly the field names
of the &#91;in_field&#93; tags in your catalog pages, or the MiniVend server
will not start.  In addition, they can only contain the characters
'-A-Za-z0-9_', with no whitespace, or they will not work properly.

When the products.asc file changes after import or edit, the DBM
database is re-built upon the next server start.


%%%
35
%%
Arbitrary Databases
%%

MiniVend can manage an unlimited number of arbitrary databases,
kept either in memory, or on disk if you don't have GDBM or DB_File.
They are in the same format as the products file by default, but
6 addressable schemes are available:

    Type 1      Default - same as products file (TAB, PIPE, or CSV)
    Type 2      Each field on its own line, a blank line or lines
                separates the record
    Type 3      Fields separated by a \n%%\n combination, records by
                \n%%%\n (where \n is a newline)
    Type 4      CSV
    Type 5      PIPE
    Type 6      TAB

The databases are specified in Database directives, as:

    Database    Arbitrary /usr/data/arbitrary.asc 4

That specifies a type 4 database, the ASCII version of which
is located in the file /usr/data/arbitrary.asc (the DBM file
will go there too, as /usr/data/arbitrary.db or arbitrary.gdbm),
and the name it will be accessed under in MiniVend is "Arbitrary".
The name is case sensitive. Fields are accessed with the
&#91;item_data name field&#93; or &#91;data name field key&#93; elements.

Catalog Pages
%%

Pages in the catalog are written in regular HTML with extensions to
support catalog ordering. To distinguish them from regular HTML, these
extended elements use square brackets instead of angular brackets.

NOTE: As of MiniVend 1.03, there are no real distinctions between
order pages and other pages -- all may access the &#91;item_list&#93; tag.

The first page displayed in the catalog, if no argument is supplied
to the vlink or svend cgi-bin program, is "catalog.html". This page
will contain links to other catalog pages with the &#91;page&#93; element.
Individual products can be ordered by the &#91;order &lt;item-code>&#93; element, which
brings up the order page "order.html". The order page contains input
boxes for the customer to type in their name and address. Once the
order has been sent the "confirmation.html" page is displayed.

If you use the vendpage utility, you will be able to write
the pages in normal HTML, then convert them en masse to the
Vend format. MiniVend tags (the ones in square brackets) can be passed
in as HTML comments -- see vendpage for details.

Unless you are using the "cookie" support, you will normally not want to
include regular hypertext links to pages outside of the catalog. Such
links will not include the session id, which means that if the customer
follows an external link back to the catalog the list of products
ordered so far will have been lost.

Inline images, on the other hand, are served in the normal fashion.
You should include a regular &lt;IMG SRC="URL"> element, where the URL
refers to a graphic image.

As of MiniVend 1.03, all you need to do to have users with cookie-capable
browsers retain session context is enable the Cookies directive.
You can then intermix standard HREF and MiniVend page links without
fear of losing the shopping basket.

NOTE: In the descriptions, parameters marked with an asterisk* are
optional.

The following elements can be used in catalog pages:



%%%
TAG-37
%%
&#91;page pg&#93;
%%
Insert a hyperlink to the specified catalog page pg. For
example, &#91;page shirts&#93; will expand into &lt;
a href="http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1">. The
catalog page displayed will come from "shirts.html" in the
pages directory.


%%%
TAG-38
%%
&#91;pagetarget pg frame&#93;
%%
Same as the page element above, except it specifies an output frame to
target if frames are turned on.  The name is case-sensitive, and if
it doesn't exist a new window will be popped up.  This is the same as
the &#91;page ...&#93; tag if frames are not activated.
For example, &#91;pagetarget shirts main&#93; will expand into a link like &lt;a
href="http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1" TARGET="main">. The
catalog page displayed will come from "shirts.html" in the
pages directory, and be output to the 'main' frame.  Careful,
frame names are case-sensitive.

Also allows specification of secure pages if the target ends with
the string __secure (which will be stripped).  If so specified,
the page will be called with SecureURL instead of VendURL.


%%%
TAG-39
%%
&#91;areatarget pg frame&#93;
%%
Inserts a Vend URL in a format to provide a targeted reference for a
client-side imagemap.  You set up the &lt;AREA> tag with:

      &lt;AREA COORDS="220,0,270,20" HREF="&#91;areatarget page frame&#93;">

If frames are enabled, this will expand to:

      &lt;AREA COORDS="220,0,270,20"
         HREF="http://machine.company.com/vlink/page?ErTxVV8l;;38" TARGET="frame">

If frames are not enabled, this will expand to:

      &lt;AREA COORDS="220,0,270,20"
         HREF="http://machine.company.com/vlink/page?ErTxVV8l;;38">


%%%
TAG-40
%%
&#91;area pg&#93;
%%
Like the areatarget element, except it will never yield
a frame target.


%%%
TAG-41
%%
&#91;/page&#93;, &#91;/pagetarget&#93;
%%
Expands into &lt;/a>. Used with the page or pagetarget elements, such as:
&#91;page shirts&#93;Our shirt collection&#91;/page&#93; or &#91;pagetarget pants main&#93; Our
pants collection&#91;/pagetarget&#93;.  They are syntactically the same, so
you can use either to terminate an anchor -- the two different ones
are provided for consistency.


%%%
TAG-42
%%
&#91;frames_on&#93;
%%
Turns on the frames processing option, which is disabled by default.
The proper way to use this is to put it ONLY in a page which is loaded
by frame-based browsers, as part of the initial frame load.  It is
persistent for the entire session, or until counteracted with a
&#91;frames_off&#93; tag.


%%%
TAG-43
%%
&#91;frames_off&#93;
%%
Turns off the frames processing option.  This can be used to disable
frames, perhaps as a clickable option for users.  It is persistent for
the entire session, or until counteracted with a &#91;frames_on&#93; tag.


%%%
TAG-44
%%
&#91;finish_order page*&#93;
%%
This element is used to give the customer, while browsing, a way to go
to the order page (or optional checkout page) after they have ordered
something. If they haven't ordered anything yet &#91;finish_order&#93; does not
appear at all on the displayed page. If they have ordered an item, the
element will expand into something like:

 &lt;a href="http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/order;WehUkATn;;1">
 Finish Incomplete Order&lt;/a>

If the optional page is supplied, that will be the order page used
to finish the order.


%%%
TAG-45
%%
&#91;order code page*&#93;
%%
Expands into a hypertext link which will include the specified
code in the list of products to order and display the order
page. code should be a product code listed in the "products"
database.


%%%
TAG-46
%%
&#91;/order&#93;
%%
Expands into &lt;/a>. Used with the order element, such as: Buy a
&#91;order TK112&#93;Toaster&#91;/order&#93; today.


%%%
TAG-47
%%
&#91;price code&#93;
%%
Expands into the price of the product identified by code as
found in the products database.


%%%
TAG-48
%%
&#91;description code&#93;
%%
Expands into the description of code as found in the products
database.


%%%
TAG-49
%%
&#91;accessories code&#93;
%%
Expands into the value of the accessories database entry for the product
identified by code as found in the products database.


%%%
TAG-50
%%
&#91;field name code&#93;
%%
Expands into the value of the field name for the product
identified by code as found in the products database.
IMPORTANT: If the field name is not a field in the
database, the MiniVend server will stop with an error.


%%%
TAG-51
%%
&#91;body n&#93;
%%
Selects from the predefined color schemes and/or backgrounds, and
just becomes a &lt;BODY> tag if none are defined. See 
Controlling Page Appearance.


%%%
TAG-52
%%
&#91;buttonbar n&#93;
%%
Selects from the predefined buttonbars, and is stripped if it
doesn't exist. See Controlling Page Appearance.


%%%
TAG-53
%%
&#91;random&#93;
%%
Selects from the predefined random messages, and is stripped if none
exist. See Controlling Page Appearance.


%%%
TAG-54
%%
&#91;item_list&#93;
%%
Places an iterative list of the items in the shopping cart.  See 
The Order Page for a description.


%%%
TAG-55
%%
&#91;/item_list&#93;
%%
Terminates the &#91;item_list&#93; tag.


%%%
TAG-56
%%
&#91;shipping_description&#93;
%%
The text description of the shipping mode currently selected.


%%%
TAG-57
%%
&#91;row nn&#93;
%%
Formats text in tables.  Intended for use in reports or &lt;PRE>&lt;/PRE> HTML
areas.  The parameter nn gives the number of columns to use. Inside the
row tag, &#91;col param=value ...&#93; tags may be used. 


%%%
TAG-58
%%
&#91;/row&#93;
%%
Terminates a &#91;row nn&#93; element.


%%%
TAG-59
%%
&#91;col width=nn wrap=yes|no gutter=n align=left|right|input spacing=n&#93;
%%
Sets up a column for use in a &#91;row&#93;. This parameter can only be contained
inside a &#91;row nn&#93; &#91;/row&#93; tag pair.  Any number of columns (that fit within
the size of the row) can be defined.

The parameters are:

    width=nn        The column width, including the gutter. Must be
                    supplied, there is no default.  A shorthand method
                    is to just supply the number as the first parameter,
                    as in &#91;col 20&#93;.
        
    gutter=n        The number of spaces used to separate the column (on
                    the right-hand side) from the next. Default is 2.
        
    spacing=n       The line spacing used for wrapped text. Default is 1,
                    or single-spaced.
        
    wrap=(yes|no)   Determines whether text that is greater in length than
                            the column width will be wrapped to the next line. Default
                            is yes.
        
    align=(L|R|I)   Determines whether text is aligned to the left (the default),
                            the right, or in a way that might display an HTML text
                            input field correctly.


%%%
TAG-60
%%
&#91;/col&#93;
%%
Terminates the column field.

%%
MiniVend Conditional HTML
%%

To build complex order forms and reports, MiniVend supplies some conditional
capabiliity with the &#91;if ...&#93; text &#91;else&#93; else-text &#91;/else&#93;&#91;/if&#93;
construct.  It allows for testing for a condition within the Vend session,
and if true, inserting text and/or HTML. If the condition is not true, no
text (or the optional &#91;else&#93; text) will be inserted.

This facility cannot be considered a language, for constructs cannot be
nested in a linear fashion, and operations cannot be performed (except
as side effects to the &#91;if&#93; tag).


%%%
TAG-62
%%
&#91;if type field op* compare*&#93;
%%
Allows conditional building of HTML based on the setting of various MiniVend
session and database values. Accessible areas are:

    session     The MiniVend session variables. Of particular interest
                are login, frames, secure, and browser.

    config      The MiniVend configuration variables. These are set
                by the directives in your MiniVend configuration file (or
                the defaults).

    value       The MiniVend user variables, typically set in search,
                control, or order forms. Variables beginning with 'mv_'
                are MiniVend special values, and should be tested/used
                with caution.

    scratch     The MiniVend scratchpad variables, which can be set
                with the &#91;set name&#93;value&#91;/set&#93; element. 

    accessory   The accessories database.

    shipping    The shipping database.

    salestax    The salestax database.

The field term is the specifier for that area.  For example, &#91;if session
frames&#93; would return true if the 'frames' session parameter was set.

As an example, consider buttonbars for frame-based setups.  It would be
nice to display a different buttonbar (with no frame targets) for sessions
that are not using frames:

    &#91;if session frames&#93;
        &#91;buttonbar 1&#93;
    &#91;else&#93;
        &#91;buttonbar 2&#93;
    &#91;/else&#93;
    &#91;/if&#93;

Another example might be the when search matches are displayed. If
you use the string '&#91;value mv_match_count&#93; titles found', it will display
a plural for only one match.  Use:

    &#91;if value mv_match_count != 1&#93;
        &#91;value mv_match_count&#93; matches found.
    &#91;else&#93;
    &#91;/else&#93;
        Only one match was found.
    &#91;/if&#93;

The op term is the compare operation to be used. Compare operations are
as in Perl:

    ==  numeric equivalence
    eq  string equivalence
    >   numeric greater-than
    gt  string greater-than
    &lt;   numeric less-than
    lt  string less-than
    !=  numeric non-equivalence
    ne  string equivalence

Any simple perl test can be used, including some limited regex matching (no
whitespace or conditionals can be contained in the comparison string). Discussion
of this is beyond the scope of this document.


%%%
TAG-63
%%
&#91;else&#93; text &#91;/else&#93;
%%
The optional else-text for an if or if_field conditional.


%%%
TAG-64
%%
&#91;/if&#93;
%%
Terminates an if conditional.


%%%
TAG-65
%%
&#91;set variable&#93;value&#91;/set&#93;
%%

Sets a scratchpad variable to value. One way this is used is to
save pages that a customer has seen -- perhaps for a rotating message.
A rotating message implementation is shown in the sample page flypage.html.

The mv_* variables that are used for search and order conditionals are
in another namespace -- they can be set by means of hidden fields in a
form.


%%%
TAG-66
%%
&#91;data area field key&#93;
%%

Returns the value of the field in any of the arbitrary databases,
or from the variable namespaces.  Databases will hide variables, so
don't name a database "session", "scratch", or any of the other
reserved names! Case is sensitive, so in a pinch you could call the
database "Session", but it would be better not to.



%%%
67
%%
On-the-fly Catalog Pages
%%

If an item is displayed on the search list (or order list) and there is
a link to a special page keyed on the item, MiniVend will attempt to
build the page "on the fly". It will look for the special page
flypage.html, which is used as a template for building the page.  If
&#91;item_field fieldname&#93;, &#91;item_price&#93;, (etc.) elements are used on the page,
quite complex and information-packed pages can be built.  The
&#91;if_field fieldname&#93; HTML &#91;/if_field&#93; pair can be used to only insert
HTML if there is a non-blank value in a particular field.


%%%
68
%%
The Order Page
%%

The order page(s) are where the items are tracked and adjusted by the
customer.  It is possible, beginning with MiniVend 1.03, to have an
unlimited number of order pages.  This allows a basket/checkout type
of ordering scheme, with custom order pages for items which have
many accessories.

The Accessories database is a place to keep conditional accessory
items for display on the order page (or anywhere else, for that matter).
This allows you to place additional conditional items on the order page,
perhaps checkboxes or a drop-down menu to select a color or style. Or
you can have whole conditional trees to automatically configure a product
to a customer's needs.

The structure of the Accessories database is a simple key-value pair --
if you have more complex accessory setups you can define one of the 
Arbitrary Databases and use that.

The following elements are used on the order page:



%%%
TAG-69
%%
&#91;value field&#93;
%%
Expands into the current value of the customer input field
named by field. See the section on input fields for more
information.


%%%
TAG-70
%%
&#91;nitems&#93;
%%
Expands into the total number of items ordered so far.


%%%
TAG-71
%%
&#91;subtotal&#93;
%%
Expands into the subtotal cost, exclusive of sales tax, of
all the items ordered so far.


%%%
TAG-72
%%
&#91;salestax&#93;
%%
Expands into the sales tax on the subtotal of all the
items ordered so far. If there is no key field to derive the
proper percentage, such as state or zip code, it is set to whatever
the default is.  See Sales Tax for more information.


%%%
TAG-73
%%
&#91;total_cost&#93;
%%
Expands into the total cost of all the items ordered so far, including
sales tax (if any).


Within any order page, the &#91;item_list&#93; element shows a list of all the
items ordered by the customer so far. It works by repeating the source
between &#91;item_list&#93; and &#91;/item_list&#93; once for each item ordered.
Between the item_list markers the following elements will return
information for the current item:



%%%
TAG-74
%%
&#91;if_field fieldname&#93;
%%
If the database field fieldname is non-blank, the following
text up to the &#91;/if_field&#93; tag is substituted. This can be used to
substitute IMG or other tags only if the corresponding source
item is present. 


%%%
TAG-75
%%
&#91;/if_field&#93;
%%
Terminates an &#91;if_field fieldname&#93; element.

COMPATIBILITY NOTE: MiniVend 1.02 used the &#91;/if&#93; end tag for
an &#91;if_field&#93; element. For compatibility, it will continue
to terminate &#91;if_field&#93; for this version, but it should be
changed.


%%%
TAG-76
%%
&#91;item_code&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the product code for the current item.


%%%
TAG-77
%%
&#91;item_data database fieldname&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the field name fieldname in the arbitrary database
table database, for the current item.


%%%
TAG-78
%%
&#91;item_description&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the product description (from the products file)
for the current item.


%%%
TAG-79
%%
&#91;item_field fieldname&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the field name fieldname in the database,  for
the current item.


%%%
TAG-80
%%
&#91;item_accessories&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the value of the Accessories database entry for
the item.


%%%
TAG-81
%%
&#91;item_increment&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the number of the item in the match list. Used
for numbering search matches or order items in the list.


%%%
TAG-82
%%
&#91;item_price&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the price (from the products file) of the current
item.


%%%
TAG-83
%%
&#91;item_quantity&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the subtotal (quantity * price) for the current item.
Quantity price breaks are taken into account.


%%%
TAG-84
%%
&#91;item_quantity&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the quantity ordered for the current item.


%%%
TAG-85
%%
&#91;quantity_name&#93;
%%
Evaluates to the name to give an input box in which the
customer can enter the quantity to order.



%%%

%%
The Search Engine
%%

MiniVend implements a search engine which will search the product
database (or any other file) for items based on customer input.  It uses
the (example) nf_sel.html, nf_search.html, fr_comb.html, fr_help.html,
and search.html files in the pages directory, and has some of its own
special tags and variables.

Two search engine interfaces are provided, and three types of searching
are available.  The default is a text-based search of the
products.asc file.  A binary search of a dictonary-ordered file can
be specified.  An optional Glimpse search is enabled by placing
the command specification for Glimpse in the directive Glimpse.

The default, a text based search, simply sequentially scans the
lines in the target file.  It returns the first field (delineated by
the standard Delimiter), for every line matching the search specification.

A number of variables can be set on search forms to determine which search
will be used, and what fields in the database it will search.
Here is a simple search form:

        &lt;FORM ACTION="&#91;process-search&#93;" METHOD=POST>
        &lt;INPUT TYPE="text" SIZE="30" NAME="mv_searchspec">
        &lt;INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="mv_todo" VALUE="Search">
        &lt;/FORM>

When the "Search" submit button is pressed (or &lt;ENTER> is pressed)
MiniVend will search the products.asc file for the string entered
into the text field mv_searchspec, and return the product
code pertaining to that line.

The same search for a fixed string, say "shirt", could be performed with
the use of a hot link, using the special scan URL:

    &#91;page scan/se=search&#93;See our shirt collection!&#91;/page&#93;

The default is to search every field on the line.
If you only wished to match on the string shirt in the product
database field "description", you could modify the search:

    &lt;INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mv_search_field" VALUE="description">

If you want to let the user decide on the search parameters, you can
use checkboxes or radiobox fields to set the fields:
    
    Search by author
       &lt;INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="mv_search_field" VALUE="author">
    Search by title
        &lt;INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="mv_search_field" VALUE="title">

Fields can be stacked -- if more than one is checked, all checked fields
will be searched. (This doesn't work for Glimpse in the return_file_name
mode, though).

To use the Glimpse search, you must build the Glimpse index based on
files in your ProductDir, or wherever the files to be searched will
be located. If you installed MiniVend in the default
/usr/local/lib/minivend, the command line to build the index for the
products file would be:

    glimpseindex -b -H /usr/local/lib/minivend/products products.asc

There are several ways to improve search speed for large catalogs.

One method that works well for large products.asc files is to split
the products.asc file into small index files (in the example, 100
lines) with the split(1) UNIX command, then index it with glimpse:

    split -100 products.asc index.asc.
    glimpseindex -H /usr/local/lib/minivend/products index.asc.*

This will dramatically increase search speeds for large catalogs, at
least if the search term is relatively unique. If it is a common string,
as you might have in a category search, you will be better off to use
the text-based search.

If the Glimpse executable is not found at MiniVend startup, the Glimpse
search will be disabled and the regular text-based search used instead.

Fast binary searching is useful for scanning large databases for
strings that match the beginning of a line.  They use the standard
Perl module Search::Dict, and are enabled through use of the mv_dict_look,
mv_dict_end, mv_dict_limit, mv_dict_fold, and mv_dict_order
variables.

See the documentation for Vend::Search for more information. (From the
MiniVend root directory, you can see it by using "perldoc Vend::Search".)

The sample nf_srch.html, nf_sel.html and fr_comb.html pages
show example search forms.  You can modify them to present the search in
any way you like -- just be careful to use the proper variable names for
passing to MiniVend.  It is also necessary that you copy the hidden
variables as-is -- they are required to interpret the request as a
search.  The special form variables are:



%%%
VAR-87
%%
mv_base_directory
%%

In the text search, set to the directory to base file searches
from.  File names without leading / characters will be based from
there.  In the Glimpse search, passed to Glimpse with the -H option,
and Glimpse will look for its indices there. Default is ProductDir.


%%%
VAR-88
%%
mv_case
%%

If this item is set to yes, the search will return items without regard
to upper or lower case.  This is the default -- set to yes if case
should be matched.  Implement with a checkbox &lt;INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX> field.


%%%
VAR-89
%%
mv_coordinate
%%

If this item is set to yes, and the number of search fields equals
the number of search specs, the search will return only items that
match field to spec.


%%%
VAR-90
%%
mv_dict_fold
%%

Make dictionary matching case-insensitive. Ignored without mv_dict_look.
NOTE: This is the reverse sense from mv_case.


%%%
VAR-91
%%
mv_dict_end
%%

Set to the string to end matching at in a dictionary-based search.
If the string at the beginning of a line lexically exceeds this value,
matching will stop. Ignored without mv_dict_look.


%%%
VAR-92
%%
mv_dict_limit
%%

Automatically set the limiting string (mv_dict_end) to be one character
greater than the mv_dict_look variable, at the character position
specified.  A value of 1, for instance, will set the limiting string
to "fprsythe" if the value of mv_dict_look is "forsythe".  A useful
value is -1, which will increment the last character (setting the 
mv_dict_end to "forsythf" in our example).  This prevents having
to scan the whole file once a unique match is found.

The order of this and the mv_dict_end variable is significant -- each
will overwrite the other.


%%%
VAR-93
%%
mv_dict_look
%%

Set to the string to begin matching at in a dictionary-based search. If
not set, the mv_dict_end, mv_dict_fold, and mv_dict_case variables will
be ignored.


%%%
VAR-94
%%
mv_dict_order
%%

Make dictionary matching follow dictionary order, where only word characters
and whitespace matter. Ignored without mv_dict_look.


%%%
VAR-95
%%
mv_doit
%%

This must be set to 'search' to make this a search page.


%%%
VAR-96
%%
mv_exact_match
%%

Normally MiniVend searches match words, as opposed to sentences.
This behavior can be overridden with mv_exact_match, which when
set will place quotes around any value in mv_searchspec or mv_dict_look.


%%%
VAR-97
%%
mv_matchlimit
%%

The page size for matches that are returned.  If more matches than
mv_matchlimit are found, the search paging mechanism will be
employed if the proper &#91;more_list&#93; is present.  Can be
implemented as a scrolling list (INPUT TYPE=SELECT) or radiobox 
(INPUT TYPE=RADIO) field.


%%%
VAR-98
%%
mv_max_matches
%%

The maximum number of records that will be returned in a search.
Default is 2000.


%%%
VAR-99
%%
mv_orsearch
%%

If this item is set to yes, the search will return items matching any
of the words in searchspec. The default is no.


%%%
VAR-100
%%
mv_profile
%%

Selects one of the pre-defined search specifications set by the
SearchProfile directive.  If the special variable within that file,
mv_last, is defined, it will prevent the scanning of the form input
for further search modifications.  The values of mv_searchspec and
mv_dict_look are always scanned, so you can specify this to do the
equivalent of setting multiple checkboxes or radioboxes with one click,
while still reading the search input text.


%%%
VAR-101
%%
mv_return_fields
%%

The fields that should be returned by the match. You should
not normally set this, as the default of field 0 only 
works well with MiniVend's key-based database method of
displaying search pages.


%%%
VAR-102
%%
mv_search_field
%%

The search field(s) to be searched, specified in one of two ways.
If the field is in the products database, it can be specified by
field name.  If in an arbitrary database, it must be specified by
row number (code cannot be specified).

If the number of instances matches the number of fields specified in the
mv_searchspec variable, and mv_coordinate is set to true, each search
field (in order specified on the form) will be matched with each search
spec (again in that order).


%%%
VAR-103
%%
mv_search_file
%%

In the text search, set to the files to be scanned for a match.  The
default if not set is to scan the products.asc file. If set multiple
times in a form (for a text search), will search all the files. One file
name per instance.

In the Glimpse search, follows the Glimpse wildcard-based file name
matching scheme.  Use with caution and a liberal dose of the Glimpse
man page.

 mv_search_match_count

Set by the search to indicate the total number of matches found.


%%%
VAR-104
%%
mv_search_over_msg
%%

The message that should be displayed if there is an overflow
condition (max_matches is exceeded). Overrides the SearchOverMsg
directive -- it is cleared by MiniVend if there is no overflow.
Somewhat deprecated by match paging.


%%%
VAR-105
%%
mv_search_page
%%

The MiniVend-style name of the page that should display the search
results.  Overrides the FrameSearchPage directive, and the default
value of 'search'.


%%%
VAR-106
%%
mv_searchspec
%%

The actual search string that is typed in by the customer. It is 
a text INPUT TYPE=TEXT field, or can be put in a select (drop-down)
list to enable category searches. If multiple instances are found,
they will be concatenated just as if multiple words had been 
placed in a text field.

The user can place quotes around words to specify that they match
as a string. To enable this by default, use the mv_exact_match
variable.

If mv_dict_look has a value, and mv_searchspec does not, then
mv_searchspec will be set to the value of mv_dict_look.

If the number of instances matches the number of fields specified in the
mv_search_field variable, and mv_coordinate is set to true, each search
field (in order specified on the form) will be matched with each search
spec (again in that order).


%%%
VAR-107
%%
mv_searchtype
%%

If set to glimpse, selects the Glimpse search (if Glimpse is defined).
If set to text, selects the text-based search. Defaults to text if
Glimpse is not defined, to Glimpse if it is. This can allow use of
both search types if that is desirable -- for instance, searching for
very common strings is better done by the text-based search. An example
might be searching for categories of items instead of individual items.


%%%
VAR-108
%%
mv_spelling_errors
%%

The number of spelling errors that will be tolerated. Ignored unless
using Glimpse. If you have a large catalog, you might wish to limit this
to two.


%%%
VAR-109
%%
mv_substring_match
%%

If mv_substring_match is  set to yes, matches on substrings as well
as whole words. You would typically want to set this for dictionary-based
searches.


The sample search page also has a link to a help file (pages/help.html)
which has rudimentary end-user help for the search engine.



%%%
110
%%
The Search Page
%%

Once a search has been done, there need be a way of presenting
the output.  By default, the special page search.html is used -- but
any number of search pages can be specified by passing the value in
the search form, specified in the variable mv_search_page.

On the search page, some special MiniVend tags are used to format
the otherwise standard HTML.  Each of the iterative tags is
applied to every code returned from the search -- this is normally
the product code, but could be a key to any of the arbitrary
databases. The value placed by the &#91;item-code&#93; tag is set to whatever
the first field (separated by whitespace) is, at least when the 
default of yes is in the UseCode directive. 

NOTE: The special item tags (item-price, item-data, item-accessory,
etc.) still refer to fields in the product database. To access arbitrary
databases, you will need to use the idiom &#91;data database field &#91;item-code&#93;&#93;.



%%%
TAG-111
%%
&#91;search_list&#93;
%%

Starts the representation of a search list. MiniVend tags can be
embedded in the search list, yielding a table or formatted
list of items with part number, description, price, and  hyperlinks to
order or go to its catalog page. 

In particular, all of the item tags described under order page
are active.  The most useful one might be &#91;item_link&#93;, which if
properly used, can allow the user to search the catalog for
an item, then click a link to go to detailed catalog page
for the item. See the sample search.html page for an example.

In fact, any of the MiniVend database access tags can be used,
allowing you to pull data from any of the fields in any of
your prefined databases.  Along with the MiniVend conditional
tags, very complex pages can be built for each individual item
returned in the search.


%%%
TAG-112
%%
&#91;/search_list&#93;
%%

Ends the search list.  


%%%
TAG-113
%%
&#91;matches&#93;
%%

Replaced with the range of match numbers displayed by the
search page.  Looks something like "1-50". Make sure
you insert this item between a &#91;more_list&#93; and &#91;/more_list&#93;
element pair.


%%%
TAG-114
%%
&#91;more_list&#93;
%%

Starts the section of the search page which only is output
if there are more matches than specified in mv_matchlimit.
If there are less matches than the number in mv_matchlimit, all
text/html between the &#91;more_list&#93; and &#91;/more_list&#93; elements is
stripped.

Use in conjunction with the &#91;more&#93; element to place pointers to
additional pages of matches.


%%%
TAG-115
%%
&#91;/more_list&#93;
%%

Companion to &#91;more_list&#93;.  


%%%
TAG-116
%%
&#91;more&#93;
%%

Inserts a series of hyperlinks that will call up the next matches
in a series. They look like this:

    Previous 1 2 3 4 5 6 Next

The current page will not be a hyperlink.  Every time the new
link is pressed, the list is re-built to correspond to the current
page.  If there is no Next or Previous page, that link
will not be shown.

See the fr_resul.html or search.html files for examples. Make sure
you insert this item between a &#91;more_list&#93; and &#91;/more_list&#93; element pair.


%%%
TAG-117
%%
&#91;item_link code&#93;
%%
Expands into a hyperlink which will jump the user to a page
under the ItemLinkDir (default is the pages directory),
with anchor text as set in ItemLinkValue (default is "More Details").
If the page is not present, then flypage.html will be used to build
a page from the entry in the database.  If that doesn't work (perhaps
due to a missing flypage.html) then the error page notfound.html will
be displayed.  Only active in the search list.


%%%
TAG-118
%%
&#91;process_search&#93;
%%
Calls the search with the proper URL, including MiniVend session tags.  Used
as the ACTION value for the search form.


%%%
TAG-119
%%
&#91;process_target frame&#93;
%%
Calls the search with the proper URL, including MiniVend session tags.
Used as the ACTION value for the search form if the results are to be
targeted to a different window than the one set by SearchFrame (which is
"_self" by default).


%%%
120
%%
Customer Input Fields
%%

On the order (or shopping basket) page, by default order.html, you will
have a number of input fields allowing customer to enter information
such as their name and address.  You can add more fields simply by
putting more input elements on the order.html page, and the information
will automatically be included in the order report. Input elements
should be written in this way:

    &lt;input type="text" name="town" value="&#91;value town&#93;" size=30>

Choose a name for this input field such as "email" for an email
address. Set the name attribute to the name you have chosen.

The value attribute specifies the default value to give the field when
the page is displayed. Because the customer may enter information on
the order page, return to browsing, and come back to the order page,
you want the default value to be what was entered the first time. This
is done with the &#91;value&#93; element, which returns the last value of an
input field. Thus,

    value="&#91;value name&#93;"

will evaluate to the name entered on the previous order screen, such
as:

       value="Jane Smith"

which will be displayed by the browser.

The size attributes specifies how many characters wide the input field
should be on the browser. You do not need to set this to fit the
longest possible value since the browser will scroll the field, but
you should set it large enough to be comfortable for the customer.

Simple Order Report File
%%

The simple order report file, "report", defines the layout of the order
report which gets mailed on the completion of the order. For example,

          Order Date: $date

            Name: $name
       Email address: $email

    Shipping address: $addr
    Town, State, Zip: $town, $state $zip
         Country: $country

Any input field from the order page can be included using the dollar
sign notation.

To prevent a value from being included in the order report, just add it
to the ReportIgnore configuration directive.  

MiniVend defines some values for use in the search form -- they begin
with 'mv_' and are automatically ignored.


%%%
123
%%
Fully-configurable Order Reports
%%

You can specify a fully-configureable order report by setting the hidden
field "mv_order_report" to a legal MiniVend page. This page will be
interpolated with all MiniVend tags before sending by email.  The order
number as set by backend ordering is in the variable mv_order_number,
and available for your use.

You could if you wish include HTML in the file, which will be interpreted
by many mailers, but you can choose to use standard ASCII format.
An example report is provided in &lt;report.html>.


%%%
124
%%
Order Receipts
%%

If you specify a legal MiniVend page name in the ReceiptPage directive,
the user will be sent this page instead of the default "confirmation.html"
file.  The file can of course be configured with all MiniVend tags, and
will be interpolated for the ordered items before they are deleted from
the user record.


%%%
125
%%
Sales Tax
%%

MiniVend allows calculation of sales tax on a straight percentage basis,
with certain items allowed to be tax-exempt.  To enable this feature,
the directive SalesTax is initialized with the name of a field (or
fields) on the order form.  Commonly, this is zipcode and/or state:

    SalesTax    zip,state

This being done, MiniVend assumes the presence of a file salestax.asc,
which contains a database with the percentages.  Each line of 
salestax.asc should be a code (again, usually a five-digit zip or
a two letter state) followed by a tab, then a percentage. Example:

    default 0
    45056   .0525
    61821   .0725
    61801   .075
    IL      .0625
    OH      .0525
    WA      .08

Based on the user's entry of information in the order form, MiniVend
will look up (for our example SalesTax directive) first the zip, then
the state, and apply the percentage to the SUBTOTAL of the order.  The
subtotal will include any taxable items, and will also include the
shipping cost if the state/zip is included in the TaxShipping directive.
It will add the percentage, then make that available with the &#91;salestax&#93;
tag for display on the order form. If no match is found, the entry
'default' is applied -- that is normally 0, but can be anything.

If business is being done on a national basis, it is now common to have
to collect sales tax for multiple states.  If you are doing so, it is possible
to subscribe to a service which issues regular updates of the sales tax
percentages -- usually by quarterly or monthly subscription.  Such a
database should be easily converted to MiniVend format -- but some systems
are rather convoluted, and it will be well to check and see if the
program can export to a flat ASCII file format based on zip code.

If some items are not taxable, then you must set up a field in your
database which indicates that. You then place the name of that field
in the NonTaxableField directive. If the field for that item
evaluates true on a yes-no basis (i.e. is set to 'yes', 'y', 1, or the
like), sales tax will not be applied to the item. If it evaluates false,
it will be taxed.

If your state taxes shipping, use the TaxShipping directive.
Utah and Nevada are known to tax shipping -- there may be others.


%%%
126
%%
Custom Shipping
%%

MiniVend allows custom shipping charges to be added to an order based on
the value of an entry in the database.  To enable custom shipping, enter
the field that will be calculated in the CustomShipping directive:

    CustomShipping  weight

The shipping cost database is a tab-separated ASCII file with six fields --
code, text description, criteria (quantity or weight, for example),
minimum number, maximum number, and cost.  None of the fields
are case-sensitive.

    code        The unique identifier for that shipping method
    description Text to describe the method, accessed with the
        &#91;shipping_description&#93; element
    criteria    Whether it is for weight, quantity, country, or whatever
        (information only, not used in program)
    minimum     The low bound of quantity/weight this entry applies to
    maximum     The high bound of quantity/weight this entry applies to
    cost        The total cost (formula if begins with 'f', or multiplier,
        if begins with 'x')

The cost is calcluated like this:

    1. The base code is selected. If there is more than one entry per
    code, numbers are appended.
    2. The criterion field is found -- if it is quantity, then it
    is in the quantity field of each item on the order form
    3. The quantity is determined, and if the quantity falls
    with in the minimum and maximum, the cost is then applied.
    4. If the cost is fixed, it is simply added.  If the cost
    field begins with an 'x', the cost is multiplied by the quantity.
    5. If no match is found, the 'default' entry is used.

An example would be this (the columns are lined up for your
reading convenience, the actual entries should have ONE tab
between fields!):

    default Slow Boat   quantity    1   99999999    3.00
    upsg1   UPS Ground  quantity    1   5           7.00
    upsg2   UPS Ground  quantity    6   10          10.00
    upsg3   UPS Ground  quantity    11  99999999    x .95
    upsb1   UPS Blue    quantity    1   5           12.00
    upsb2   UPS Blue    quantity    6   10          17.00
    upsb3   UPS Blue    quantity    11  99999999    x 1.60
    upsr1   UPS Red     quantity    1   5           17.00
    upsr2   UPS Red     quantity    6   10          22.00
    upsr3   UPS Red     quantity    11  99999999    x 2.10

If the user selected UPS Blue (code UPSB), and the quantity on the order
was 3, the cost of 12.00 from upsb1 would be applied.  If the
quantity were 7, the next entry from upsb2 would be selected, for a
cost of 17.00.  If the quantity were 15, upsb3 would be selected, and
the quantity of 15 multiplied by 1.60, for a total cost of 24.00.

If a default shipping mode other than 'default' is desired, enter
it into the DefaultShipping directive:

    DefaultShipping     UPSG

This will make the &lt;INPUT TYPE=RADIO NAME=mv_shipmode VALUE=upsg> entry
on the order form checked by default when the user starts the order process.

%%
Tracking and Backend Order Entry
%%

MiniVend has a tracking  option, enabled with the configuration
directive Tracking.  Entered orders and page popularity are tracked.
The tracking database is also used to hold encrypted data such as credit
card numbers, expiration dates, and the encrypted MiniVend password.

The Tracking directive must be a non-blank value to enable tracking.  In
addition, if the tracking database is not yet initialized, the Tracking
directive is used to initialize the first order number to be placed in
the tracking database. After that initialization, the value of the next
order number is kept in the database (under the key mv_next_order) and
incremented when an order is placed.  The incrementation is alpha-numeric,
so it is important to have leading zeros in any string value -- i.e., an
initial value of Order00009 will be incremented to Order00010, while
an initial value of Order9 will be incremented to Ordes0. Also, any
non-alphanumeric characters will be stripped -- Order_00000 becomes
Order00000.

The tracking is done by entering information in the DBM database tracking in
the product directory (ProductDir). Orders are tracked under two keys,
the actual key (started by the Tracking Directive) and a key that prepends the
string "Backend" to the actual key. The entry in the actual key is a facsimile
of the emailed order report -- the Backend key is the values selected in the 
BackendOrder directive, combined with the actual ordered item codes and
quantities, separated by NUL characters (ASCII code 0).

To illustrate, take a MiniVend system that has tracking enabled with
these two configuration directives in the minivend.cfg file:

    Tracking        Order00001
    BackendOrder    name,address,city,state,zip,account,mv_shipmode

When the user places an order for quantity 2 of item number P-133,
the tracking database will have two keys/values added:

 Key               Value
 ----------------  ----------------------------
 Order00001        (The order report, filled in -- see "Order Report File")
 BackendOrder00001 Joe J. User&lt;NUL>123 Any St.&lt;NUL>MainStreet&lt;NUL>OH&lt;NUL>
           12345&lt;NUL>Acct#123&lt;NUL>P-133&lt;NUL>2

If the customer left a credit card number with the SSL account information form
(see Order Security), the credit card number and its associated expiration
date will be placed in two additional fields:

 Key               Value
 ----------------  ----------------------------
 CcOrder00001      (encrypted data)
 ExpOrder00001     (encrypted data)


The scheme allows a history of orders to be kept (the Order00001 key)
and a list of unentered orders (the BackendOrder00001 key, along with
the CcOrder00001 and ExpOrder00001 keys).  An external program can read
the tracking database and submit the orders to an order-entry system,
removing (or undefining) the BackendOrder, CcOrder, and ExpOrder keys
when finished. An rudimentary example script which displays the tracking
database is supplied as 'trackrpt' in the bin/ directory. This script
could be easily modified to actually perform batch order entry.

Page popularity is simply tracked by storing a count of accesses, with
the page name as the key.  No additional information is stored. It is
designed to give the catalog designer an idea of which features, pages,
and menus are popular, and which are rarely used.  Since individual page
accesses are tracked, it might also give marketing or sales an idea of
problems with product perception -- if an item were frequently looked
at, but rarely bought, it might be appropriate to re-write the catalog
page.


%%%
128
%%
Easy ASCII Tracking
%%

Instead of the DBM-based tracking, you can choose to track only orders
and not pages with the AsciiBackend and AsciiTrack directives.

If you set AsciiTrack to a legal file name (based in VendRoot unless
it has a leading "/"), a copy of the order will be saved there as well
as being emailed.

If you set AsciiBackend to a legal file name (based in VendRoot unless
it has a leading "/"), it will save the backend fields along with
the item-code and quantity of items being ordered.

For either directive, if the file name string begins with a pipe "|", 
a program will be run and the output "piped" to that program. This
allows easy backend entry of orders with an external program.


%%%
129
%%
The Order Counter
%%

An order counter can be enabled if the OrderCounter directive
is set to a file name.  An incrementing count of all orders will be
kept and assigned as orders are placed.  By default, the number
starts at 0, but you can edit the file and change the default
starting number at any time.

This capability is made possible by the File::CounterFile module,
available (as a part of the fine libwww modules) at the same place you
got MiniVend.  It is included with the distribution.


%%%
130
%%
Order Security
%%

MiniVend has several features that enable secure ordering via SSL
(Secure Sockets Layer). Despite their mystique, SSL servers are actually
quite easy to operate.  The difference between the standard HTTP server
and the SSL HTTPS server, from the standpoint of the user, is only in
the encryption and the specification of the URL -- https: is used for the
URL protocol specification instead of the usual http: designation.

IMPORTANT NOTE:  MiniVend attempts to perform operations securely,
but no guarantees or warrantees of any kind are made! Since MiniVend
comes with Perl source, it is possible to modify the program to create
bad security problems. One way to minimize this possibility is to record
digital signatures, using MD5 or PGP, of minivend.pl,
minivend.cfg, and all modules included in minivend.pl (standard ones are
Vend/Server.pm, Vend/Imagemap.pm, Vend/Http.pm, Vend/lock.pm, and
possibly Des). Check them on a regular basis to ensure they have not
been changed.

MiniVend uses the SecureURL directive to set the base URL for secure
transactions, and the VendURL directive for normal non-secure transactions.
Secure URLs can be enabled for forms through the &#91;process_target action secure&#93;
element, pages through the &#91;pagetarget page frame__secure&#93; element, and
access to the secure account information form is available through the
&#91;secure_order&#93; element.

MiniVend incorporates additional security for credit card numbers.  Any field
on the order form which has credit_card in its name will not be written
to disk unless it is encrypted.  Either an external encryption program, such
as crypt(1) or des(1), can be used, or for internal encryption, the Perl
Des module can be used.  The Des module can be defined at program 
configuration time, or can be inserted in the minivend.pl configuration
section as the line:

  use Des;

The Des module is available at the same sites as Perl Version 5. It
also requires a functional libdes library, which will be harder to
obtain.

To accept credit_card fields, you need to define several things in
minivend.cfg (or with MAT). First, the directive CreditCards needs
to be set to yes. Also, Tracking needs to be enabled, to provide a
place to store the credit card numbers as well as a place to store your
access password. EncryptProgram also needs to be defined with at
least some value.  If using the internal Des support, the entries
should look something like:

  CreditCards      Yes
  Tracking         Order00001
  EncryptProgram   internal

If you wish to use an external encryption program, recognize
that this is not nearly as secure as using the internal Des option,
for the design of most encryption programs prevents secure transmission
of the password.  The password has to be sent on the command line, and
though MiniVend tries to hide it, not all operating systems will prevent
access to the password through the ps(1) command. If you decide this is
acceptable, here is an example EncryptProgram definition that will work
for many des(1) implementations:

  EncryptProgram   /usr/bin/des -e -k %p &lt; %f

The %p parameter indicates the location where the password will be placed
in the command line, and %f is the placeholder for the input file name.
Consult your des(1) manual page for details on how the command line should be
constructed.

If your encryption program allows the password to be placed on the first
line of the text to be encrypted, omit the %p specification.  MiniVend will
send the password, followed by a newline, before sending the text to be
encrypted.  This is much more secure than a command line password, but your
encryption program may not allow this mode of operation.

If the CreditCards, EncryptProgram and Tracking directives are
defined at program startup, MiniVend will prompt for a password before
starting the server.  This password is checked against a password
previously stored in the tracking database (if it exists), otherwise
MiniVend prompts for a second entry to verify a new password, which is
then stored in the tracking database.  Three tries can be made before
MiniVend gives up.

If encryption is not enabled, MiniVend will silently overwrite any fields
in the order form(s) with X characters.  This prevents non-authorized startups
from saving any sensitive information to disk.

Using Frames
%%

MiniVend fully supports frames, the proposed extension to HTML 3.0. (Currently
only Netscape 2.0 and above browsers support frames.) Frames significantly
enhance the electronic catalog experience, since the user can maintain
a context -- with a search frame, a product details frame, a table-of-contents
frame, etc. The demo included with MiniVend is based on frames, though if
you access it with a non-frame browser it will operate perfectly well.

Frames are accessed by adding a TARGET element to a HREF, naming
the frame that the referenced URL should be placed in. MiniVend
produces targets with the pagetarget and areatarget elements, which
send target tags if frames are enabled (by a &#91;frames_on&#93; element.
Any frame name can be used, including the special frames of _top, _blank,
_parent, and _self.

As shown in the demo pages, the best way to accommodate both types of
browsers is by having an index.html page that sets the beginning
frame set.  The &lt;FRAMESET> and &lt;FRAME> tags will be ignored by standard
browsers, which will read the HTML between the &lt;NOFRAMES> and &lt;/NOFRAMES>
tags below.

The format of the first set of URLs passed to the frames is important - only
ONE MiniVend link must be called.  That sets the session ID for the user. If
two URLs were called, MiniVend would assign two session IDs to the user,
scrambling the context of their navigation.  From this single access,
all further references to MiniVend are made, though after the first access
multiple frame targets can be referenced.

This first MiniVend page that is accessed (with a frame browser) should
contain a &#91;frames_on&#93; element.  It is the only page that need (or should)
contain a &#91;frames_on&#93;, which is persistent throughout the session. This
page should never be seen by a non-frame browser.

Subsequent accesses to MiniVend URLs will now contain the proper session
information, and as long as pagetarget or page elements are used to
pass the URLs, context will be maintained.

The &#91;pagetarget page frame&#93; element is used to pass target tags in hyperlinks.
The &#91;areatarget page frame&#93; element is used to pass target tags in imagemaps.
The &#91;frames_on&#93; and &#91;frames_off&#93; elements enable and disable frame operation.
The &#91;framebase frame&#93; element sets a base target for a page.

See the demo pages:

    fr_greet.html   Starting frame for frames-based browsers - has &#91;frames_on&#93;
    nf_greet.html   Turns off frames -- has &#91;frames_off&#93;
    reframe.html    Re-enables frames after they have been turned off

Controlling Page Appearance
%%

MiniVend provides centralized page color and imagemap control through
use of the &#91;body n&#93; and &#91;buttonbar n&#93; elements. It also can place a random
message from a series of messages with the &#91;random&#93; element, and embed
help messages with the &#91;help item&#93; element.

The &#91;body n&#93; element selects a color scheme -- numbered from 1 to 15 --
that is set by the Mv_Background, Mv_TextColor, Mv_BgColor,
Mv_LinkColor, and Mv_VlinkColor directives. Each can contain up to 15
parameters, after an opening BEGIN. Here is an example:

    Mv_Background  BEGIN /images/blue_pap.gif
    Mv_BgColor     BEGIN none steelblue white
    Mv_LinkColor   BEGIN none white black
    Mv_TextColor   BEGIN none ltgreen blue
    Mv_VlinkColor  BEGIN none orange purple

The above sequence (set in the minivend.cfg file, or through MAT)
defines three color schemes, accessed with &#91;body 1&#93;, &#91;body 2&#93;, and &#91;body 3&#93;
elements in MiniVend pages.  The first scheme uses the file 
/images/blue_pap.gif as the background pattern, and keeps
the user's default colors for everything else.  It is called 
by a &#91;body 1&#93; element, which when expanded becomes &lt;BODY
BACKGROUND="/images/blue_pap.gif>.

The second scheme defines no background pattern (there is only one file
in the Mv_Background directive), but defines a background color of 'steelblue',
with a text color of white, a link color of light green, and a visited link
color of orange. It is accessed by the &#91;body 2&#93; element, which when expanded
becomes &lt;BODY BGCOLOR="steelblue" TEXT="white" LINK="ltgreen" VLINK="orange">.

The third color scheme is similar to the second, except defines
white-black-blue-purple for the four colors.  It is accessed with
a &#91;body 3&#93; element.

If there is no defined scheme for a body element (as there wouldn't be if
you put &#91;body 4&#93; in a page with the above schemes defined) MiniVend
simply outputs a standard &lt;BODY> tag.

The user can also define their own colors if the Mv_customcolors
variable is set (upon a form submission).  See the supplied
control.html page for an example of how to set custom colors.

Image maps can be supplied and similarly controlled with the &#91;buttonbar n&#93;
series of tags.  They are defined with the ButtonBars directive (also set
in minivend.cfg or with MAT), and take the form of a series of
file names in MiniVend format -- i.e., relative to the PageDir and
without a .html extension. To use the buttonbars, create a file 
with an IMG directive set with the USEMAP element and an associated
client-side image map (defined with &lt;MAP> &lt;/MAP>. The &#91;areatarget&#93;
or &#91;area&#93; tags are used to set the URLs. An example:

    &lt;IMG SRC="/sample/images/artbar0.gif" USEMAP="#ARTBAR0">
    &lt;MAP NAME=ARTBAR0>
    &lt;AREA COORDS="198,0,278,20" HREF="&#91;areatarget fr_sel search&#93;">
    &lt;AREA COORDS="303,0,363,20" HREF="&#91;areatarget fr_search search&#93;">
    &lt;AREA COORDS="388,0,442,20" HREF="&#91;areatarget fr_greet main&#93;">
    &lt;AREA COORDS="473,0,537,20" HREF="&#91;areatarget control main&#93;">
    &lt;AREA COORDS="0,0,560,20" NOHREF>
    &lt;/MAP>

If the above were saved in the file PageDir/bars/artbar0.html (where PageDir
is your MiniVend pages directory), you would be able to access this
imagemap in your pages with a &#91;buttonbar 0&#93; tag, at least after MiniVend
read this line in the configuration file:

    ButtonBars  bars/artbar0 bars/artbar1 bars/artbar2

The above entry allows you to define three imagemaps and access them in
your pages simply as &#91;buttonbar 0&#93;, &#91;buttonbar 1&#93;, and &#91;buttonbar 2&#93;. The
advantage of this scheme is central definition of a series of button bars
with only a few tags -- if you change your page colors or mapping, you
need only change one file and the change will roll over to all of your
catalog pages. Since some installations can number in the thousands
of catalog pages, using the pre-defined buttonbars can save a lot of
editing. (Server-side includes cannot be used to achieve the same thing
with MiniVend, since they wouldn't have the proper URLs.)

Imagemaps can also be defined on forms, with the special form variable
mv_todo.map.  A series of map actions can be defined --
the action specified in the default entry will be applied if none
of the other coordinates match. The image is specified with a standard
HTML 2.0 form field of type IMAGE.  Here is an example:

 &lt;INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="rect submit 0,0 100,20">
 &lt;INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="rect cancel 290,2 342,18">
 &lt;INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="default refresh">
 &lt;INPUT TYPE="IMAGE" NAME="mv_todo" SRC="url_of_image">

All of the actions will be combined together into one image map with
NCSA-style functionality -- see the NCSA imagemap documentation for
details -- except that MiniVend form actions are defined instead
of URLs.  The standard actions are:

 submit   Submit order
 refresh  Refresh order page (update quantities, etc.)
 cancel   Cancel order and wipe credit card numbers
 return   Go to previous page (or page defined in mv_nextpage variable)
 control  Control help, colors, etc.
 search   Search for an item in the catalog

The &#91;random&#93; element, in conjunction with the Random directive in the
minivend.cfg file (or set with MAT), is similar to the
buttonbar tag, except it displays random messages or images.  It can be
used to place a random tip, hint, ad, or message, and can be any
legal HTML construct. It cannot contain MiniVend elements.

The &#91;help tag&#93; element, in conjunction with the Help directive in the
minivend.cfg file (or, of course, set with MAT), is similar to the
buttonbar tag, except it displays help messages or images, and is
keyed by item name.  The help can be contained in any of a series
of files defined in the Help directive. It can contain most MiniVend
elements.  The user can turn off help through a form -- see the control.html
file for an example.

By default, only the user account that MiniVend runs under (as set by the
setuid permission on svend) can read and write files created by MiniVend.
WritePermission and ReadPermission can be set to 'user', 'group', or
'world'.

    WritePermission     group

%%
A comma-separated list of items you want to make sure the customer fills
in before an order can be submitted.  If an empty field is found when
the customer submits the order, the special page needfield.html will
be displayed to request that they enter the information. No default.

SalesTax
%%
If non-blank, enables automatic addtion of sales tax based on the order
form.  The value is a comma-separated list of the field names (as placed
in order.html), in priority order, which should be used to look up sales
tax percentage in the salestax.asc database. This database is not
supplied with MiniVend -- it is typically received from a third party by
quarterly or monthly subscription.

The frame name where search results will go, if frames are enabled.
If the frame doesn't exist, a new frame will be created.  The default
is '_self'.

    SearchFrame         main


%%%
DIR-187
%%
SearchProfile
%%
Allows an unlimited number of search profiles to be set up, specifying
complex searches based on a single click. Takes a series of MiniVend
variable specifications.

As an added measure of control, the specification is evaluated with the
special MiniVend &#91;if area value ....&#93;value&#91;else&#93;other value&#91;/else&#93;&#91;/if&#93;
syntax to provide conditional setting of search parameters.

The following file specifies a dictionary-based search in the file
'dict.product':

    mv_search_file=dict.product
    mv_return_fields=1
    &#91;if value fast_search&#93;
        mv_dict_limit=-1
        mv_last=1
    &#91;/if&#93;

The search profiles are specified in the same manner as the
ButtonBars directive, with files to be located in the MiniVend page
tree and read at program startup. If you change a search profile, you
must stop and start MiniVend to have the changes take effect.

    SearchProfile    srch/search0 srch/search1 srch/search2

They are accessed by setting the mv_profile variable to the number
of the search profile.

SessionExpire
%%
A customer can exit their browser or leave the catalog pages at any
time, and no indication is given to the HTTPD server aside from the
lack of further requests that have the same session id. Old session
information needs to be periodically expired. The SessionExpire
specifies the minimum time to keep track of session information.
Defaults to one day.

Enables order and popularity tracking when entered, as well as enabling
password and credit card encryption for order security (in combination
with the EncryptProgram directive). Its value is the initial order
number that will be used as the beginning key for orders in the tracking
database. See Tracking and Backend Order Entry and Order Security.

UseCode
%%
This determines whether the part number field in the ASCII product file
will be used to determine the link to the item for the &#91;item_link&#93; tag.
If set, this has the effect of creating a different HTML page link for
every part number.  If not set (the default), the &#91;item_link&#93; tag
uses the value of the last field in the ASCII product file as the link
value.  This option can be used to great effect with a program which
automatically creates catalog pages from the database.

    UseCode             yes




%%%

Required Pages
%%

A number of HTML pages are required for MiniVend operation.  Typically they
are used to transmit error messages, status of search or order operatations, and
other out of boundary conditions.

As of MiniVend 1.03, the names of these pages can be set with the SpecialPage
directive. The standard pages and their default locations:



%%%
197
%%
badsearch (pages/badsearch.html)
%%
The error page displayed if there is a system or user error with the search
engine.


%%%
198
%%
canceled.html (pages/badsearch.html)
%%
The page displayed by MiniVend when an order has been canceled by
the user.


%%%
199
%%
catalog (pages/catalog.html)
%%
The main catalog page presented by MiniVend when another page is
not specified.


%%%
200
%%
checkout (pages/order.html)
%%
The page the customer is sent to when checking out (the
location pointed to by a &#91;finish_order&#93; tag.


%%%
201
%%
confirmation.html (pages/badsearch.html)
%%
After the order is completed, the confirmation page is
displayed.


%%%
202
%%
failed (pages/failed.html)
%%
If the sendmail program could not be invoked to email the
completed order, the failed.html page is displayed. (Sadly we
don't know if the email was successfully delivered).


%%%
203
%%
flypage (pages/flypage.html)
%%
If the catalog page for an item was not found when its &#91;item_link&#93;
is clicked, this page is used as a template to build an on-the-fly
page. See On-the-fly Catalog Pages.


%%%
204
%%
interact (pages/interact.html)
%%
Displayed if an unexpected response was received from the
browser, such as not getting expected fields from submitting a
form. This would probably happen from typos in the html pages,
but could be a browser bug.


%%%
205
%%
missing (pages/missing.html)
%%
This page is displayed if the URL from the browser specifies a
page that does not have a matching .html file in the pages
directory. This can happen if the customer saved a bookmark to
a page that was later removed from the database.


%%%
206
%%
needfield (pages/needfield.html)
%%
Displayed if the user did not fill in a required field in the
order form.  See REQUIRED FIELDS.


%%%
207
%%
nomatch (pages/nomatch.html)
%%
This page is displayed if the search engine is used, but there
is no match for the search specification.


%%%
208
%%
noproduct (pages/noproduct.html)
%%
This page is displayed if the URL from the browser specifies
the ordering of a product code which is not in the products
file.


%%%
209
%%
order (pages/order.html)
%%
This page is displayed when the customer orders an item. It can contain
any or all of the customer-entered values, but is commonly used as a
status display (or "shopping basket").  If frames are in use, the
special order page can be configured with the directive
FrameOrderPage.


%%%
210
%%
search (pages/search.html)
%%
Contains the default output page for the search engine results.  Also
required is an input page, which can be the same as search.html or an
additional page.  Five sample input pages are supplied with the demo -
nf_sel.html, nf_search.html, selframe.html, schframe.html, and
fr_comb.html.  An alternate fr_resul.html is a search page for the
full-featured demo -- see FrameSearchPage.


%%%
211
%%
violation (pages/violation.html)
%%
Displayed if a security violation is noted, such as an attempt to
submit a credit card number on a non-secured form when in ExtraSecure
mode.



%%%
212
%%
ADMINISTERING MINIVEND
%%

There is a supplied administration utility, MAT, the MiniVend
Administration Tool, which has its own documentation.  It allows you
to perform most of the following operations via a web browser.


%%%
213
%%
Starting, Stopping, and Re-starting the Servers
%%

When running in server mode, MiniVend operates much faster. Since
it is loaded once, and keeps some of the database files open continuously,
it merely needs to field the CGI request (via vlink) and perform
the appropriate function.  But because it is running, some of the 
databases are locked -- and you will need to unlock them to perform
administrative functions. MAT or the supplied scripts will do that
for you.

Several utilities are supplied in the VendRoot/bin directory:

    stop       Stops the server(s)
    start      Starts the server(s)
    restart    Re-starts the server (simply stops and starts)
    testpages  Tests the MiniVend page tree for syntax and database 
               errors

The following commands assume that you made /usr/local/lib/minivend
your MiniVend base directory.

To start the server:

    /usr/local/lib/minivend/bin/start &#91;n&#93;

If the optional n, an integer from 1 to 9, is supplied, that number
of servers will be started (assuming you have the MultiServer directive
set to yes.

Assuming the server starts correctly, you will see a message stating
the process ID it is running under -- that information is also sent
to /usr/local/lib/minivend/error.log.

To re-start the server:

    /usr/local/lib/minivend/bin/restart &#91;n&#93;

This is typically done to force MiniVend to re-read its configuration.
You will see a message stating that a TERM signal has been sent to the
process ID the servers are running under -- that information is also
sent to /usr/local/lib/minivend/error.log.  Check the error.log file for
confirmation that the server has restarted properly.

To stop the server(s):

    /usr/local/lib/minivend/bin/stop

You will see a message stating that a TERM signal has been sent to
the process ID the server is running under -- that information is also sent
to /usr/local/lib/minivend/error.log.  

Because processes waiting for lock in MultiServer mode are blocking signals,
they may have to be killed more than once to die.  This is normal and
is of no concern.


%%%
214
%%
Checking Page Syntax
%%

Any time you change the pages or the database, you should run the 
testpages command.  It iterates through the MiniVend page tree, checking
form values (if you have HTML::Parse and its associated modules), page
links, and some configuration values.  It is run with:

    /usr/local/lib/minivend/testpages &#91;pages to test&#93;

The &#91;pages to test&#93; are in MiniVend path name format, relative to PageDir.
If you don't enter any, all pages will be tested -- this can take a long
time if you have a large page tree.

Forms are checked if you have the HTML::Parse module, available at
any CPAN archive (where you obtained Perl).


%%%
215
%%
Making the Product Database
%%

As of MiniVend 1.02, the product database is made automatically upon
server startup, and no special command is required.  You must not
use the old makedbm command from V1.01.


%%%
216
%%
Expiring Sessions
%%

You should periodically expire old sessions to keep the session
database file from growing too large. Either manually do this
with MAT, or directly execute minivend.pl to do this:

    /usr/local/lib/minivend/minivend.pl -expire

You could add a crontab entry such as the following:

    # once a day at 4:40 am
    40 4 * * *    perl /usr/local/lib/minivend/minivend.pl -expire

MiniVend will wait until the current transaction is finished before
expiring, so you can do this at any time without disabling web access.
Any search cache files for the affected session (kept in ScratchDir)
will be removed as well.

NOTE: DB_File users may have to stop the server before running
expire when on a BSD system.

General Information
%%
MiniVend is a freely-redistributable electronic catalog, otherwise known as a
shopping cart.  It serves a catalog via the World Wide Web, allowing
users to select items for placement on their shopping list, or cart, and
then buy them by filling out an order form.  Since MiniVend supports
Secure Sockets Layer (SSL), the customer can securely put their credit
card number in the form if you have an HTTP server that supports SSL.

MiniVend supports a host of features -- a complete list is available at
its web home page:

MiniVend is intended to work on Perl Version 5.001m and higher, but
the author does not have the resources (read time) to regression
test all versions with the different versions of Perl.  MiniVend
will definitely be tested with the last major release of Perl at
the time of package release.  As of this writing, MiniVend's
version is 1.02 and Perl's latest version is 5.002.

If you are intending to run MiniVend on an ISP
%%
Many Internet Service Provider (ISP) systems have difficulty with
one or the other aspect of running MiniVend.  A few cannot (or will
not) run MiniVend at all.  On top of that, many times ISP personnel are
too busy to help, won't help, or don't know enough to help.  Some are
secretive about details of the setup of their systems.  And some
systems are so overtaxed that MiniVend (especially in static mode)
performs poorly.

In short, be forewarned.  Don't expect a trouble-free installation on an
ISP. A list of some of the [page scan/se=ISP/mp=1]common
problems seen with ISPs[/page] is included in this FAQ.

About Vend, MiniVend's parent</A>
%%
Vend was written by Andrew Wilcox in the early part of 1995, and
the first released (beta) version was 0.2.  Vend 0.2 is the
parent of MiniVend, and the first version of MiniVend (called
Vend 0.2m7) was totally based on that.  It added searching and
DBM catalog storage.  Subsequent versions took parts from Vend
0.3, especially the VLINK and Server.pm modules, which were 
adapted to run with MiniVend.  Other portions have been adopted,
but there are distinct differences between MiniVend and Vend.

Vend's offical WWW site is:

Configuration Problems
%%

Since Mini Vend can run on a number of platforms, basically any UNIX
with Perl 5, there are a lot of "gotchas" in the portability end.
If you have a problem, you should check the MiniVend web site for
information about patches and problems already solved.


%%%
FAQ-HSP-Q02
%%
VLINK compile problems
%%
The latest version of vlink.c, svend.c, and mat.c have been compiled on
(at least) the following systems without problem:


<XMP>
        BSD2.0 (Pentium/x86)
        SunOS 4.1.4
        Solaris 2.4
        IRIX 5.3
        Linux 1.2.13
        Digital UNIX (OSF/Alpha)

</XMP>

Make sure that you have run the configure program in the src directory.
If you used MiniVend's configuration, and selected the default
of compiling those programs, the configuration was run, and
all of the proper libraries should be used.

Known problems:


<DL>
<DT>IRIX</DT>
<DD>vlink.c shipped with MiniVend 1.02 ailed with the setenv call
    not found during the link
    phase.  The solution is to edit vlink.c to use the putenv() call
    instead (as is used for SunOS).  If you don't feel comfortable
    with that, you can download the latest vlink.c from the URL:
</DD>
<DT>SOLARIS using GCC</DT>
<DD>The socket libraries sometimes are not picked
	up, and compiling with -lsocket seems to solve it.  Also, at least
	one site had problems with setregid() and setreuid() calls -- that

	set up for your system -- the solution is usually to use the
	precompiled GCC to compile the latest version of GCC on your 
	system. If you can't do that, try compiling with -DSVR4. In the

No DBM implementation
%%
This shows up when trying to start the MiniVend server, with a message:


<XMP>
        No DBM defined! MiniVend can't run.

</XMP>

This could be one of two things. MiniVend 1.02 has
a problem with automatic DBM detection on Perl versions lower than
5.002 -- you can get a patch (from the <A HREF="http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/bugs.html"> bug list</A>).

Or you might not have a proper DBM for use with MiniVend.  MiniVend relies
on DBM databases for a number of things, most notably the session database.
Some operating systems (or Perl incantations) don't support one of the
three DBMs MiniVend will recognize (GDBM, DB_File, and NDBM).

Perl always has SDBM available.  However, MiniVend can create some
large session records, larger than the 1024 byte total key/value
limitation of SDBM. This will very probably cause problems. (Some old
versions of NDBM will also have this limit.)

If you want to try to use 1024-byte NDBM or SDBM, perhaps just for testing
purposes, you can.  SDBM will take a small edit of minivend.pl:


<XMP>
        perl -npi -e 's/NDBM/SDBM/g' minivend.pl

</XMP>

If you have MiniVend 1.02, you will also have to obtain the patch from
the MiniVend web site for enabling NDBM.

The better solution is to obtain the DB_File library module from a CPAN
site and install it in the VendRoot/Vend directory.
%%%
FAQ-HSP-Q04
%%
Error -- the MiniVend server was not running...
%%
This indicates that VLINK is not communicating with the MiniVend server.
The server must be running, first of all.  If you didn't start it,
you can do so by going to the <EM>MiniVend home directory</EM> and typing:


<XMP>
        bin/start

</XMP>

You can check to see if your server is running by typing:


<XMP>
    Linux, SunOS, BSD:    ps -ax | grep minivend
    Most other systems:   ps -elf | grep minivend

</XMP>

If VLINK is not communicating with the server, there are a number of possible
reasons.  First, if you are trying to run MiniVend on an ISP, go to the section
about ISP problems -- it is probably one of those.  If you are running
MiniVend on a single machine, it is probably one of:

        1. Permissions problems
        2. MiniVend on NFS-mounted file system

Permissions are easy.  If you for some reason can't run VLINK as an SUID
program (SUID to your user ID, not to root), then you will need to 
make permissions more permissive.  See the MiniVend documentation
for how to use the ReadPermission and WritePermission directives to
make the session files and sockets 'group' or 'world' readable and writable.
If you can make your UID, or the one you have chosen to own MiniVend, the
same group as your HTTP user, then you can make the files group read-write.
If you can't, you will have to set the dreaded 'world' permissions.

If you are running MiniVend on an NFS-mounted file system it cannot run
in server mode, because UNIX-domain sockets don't work on NFS. You will
need to change to static mode from server mode, or better yet, put
MiniVend on a filesystem that is directly mounted.

%%%
FAQ-ISP-Q01
%%
No shell access allowed on my ISP.
%%
If this is the case, you are almost certainly out of luck. While
it would be possible for the ISP to configure MiniVend for you,
most don't have the time or patience to deal with it unless you
are paying them a lot of money.

You could contact Mike Heins for some pointers to ISPs who have
MiniVend compatibility, or wait for a future release (which may
have a Perl client program). Or if you had access to an identical
system with which to configure MiniVend and compile VLINK, you might
have some success.

%%%
FAQ-ISP-Q02
%%
No C compiler to compile VLINK or SVEND.
%%
As of this writing, with MiniVend 1.02 being the latest version,
this is a show stopper.  Since VLINK and SVEND need certain values
set in the source before compilation, a pre-compiled version will
not work.  If your ISP will compile programs for you, or you can
get access to a system with the same operating system and libraries,
you might have luck.  But probably you won't.

%%%
FAQ-ISP-Q03
%%
Perl version too low
%%
MiniVend requires Perl 5.001m or higher, and suggests 5.002. Earlier
patchlevels of perl 5 may work, but no problems with them will be touched by
the author.

Perl 4 will definitely not work -- and there isn't even a remote
chance it will in the future.

%%%
FAQ-ISP-Q04
%%
No usable DBM implementation
%%
If your provider compiled Perl such that it doesn't have a GDBM,
DB_File, or NDBM database defined, you will have problems.  MiniVend
can create some large session records, larger than the 1024 byte
total key/value limitation of SDBM (which is always there). This will
very probably cause problems. (Some old versions of NDBM will
also have this limit.)

If you want to try to use 1024-byte NDBM or SDBM, perhaps just for testing
purposes, you can.  SDBM will take a small edit of minivend.pl:

        perl -npi -e 's/NDBM/SDBM/g'

You will also have to obtain the patch from the MiniVend web site
for enabling older DBM versions.

The better solution is to obtain the DB_File library module from a CPAN
site and install it in the VendRoot/Vend directory.

FAQ-ISP-Q05

MiniVend runs, but it's sooo sllooowww...
%%
If you are forced to run MiniVend in static mode because of ISP problems
(see below), you may find that the pages take 10-30 seconds to load
and display.  This is almost certainly due to an ISP system that has
inadequate memory or network bandwidth.  On a moderately fast ISP
server with sufficient memory, pages should display in from 1-5 seconds.

FAQ-ISP-Q06
%%
Error - The MiniVend server was not running...
%%
The below all assume you were able to start the MiniVend server.

This could be almost anything, but with a properly configured MiniVend
it is almost undoubtedly due to your CGI-BIN and/or your MiniVend
directory being located on a different filesystem than the actual machine
that is executing the program.  VLINK uses UNIX-domain sockets, which
don't work on NFS-mounted filesystems.

A TCP version of VLINK called TLINK is distributed with MiniVend,
along with a Server.pm.tcp module. This will take some prodigious
hacking to make work -- be forewarned. MiniVend 1.03 may contain
a Perl-based TCP client, which will make this easier.  But one
caveat -- using the TCP client will make transactions TOTALLY 
INSECURE.  This is one reason MiniVend uses UNIX-domain sockets,
which are always on the same filesystem as the program, meaning
no unencrypted SSL data gets sent over the wire.

FAQ-ISP-Q07
%%
DOCUMENT CONTAINS NO DATA error on SVEND
%%
See the question "The MiniVend server was not running". 
This probably means that SVEND is unable to find the
minivend.pl program and run it.  Unlike VLINK, SVEND will work on
NFS-mounted file systems, but it must have the proper path (and the
proper paths/URLs must be configured into MiniVend) for it to work.
Without a competent and understanding support person from your ISP, this
will be difficult to resolve.

FAQ-ISP-Q08
%%
My provider runs Windows NT
%%
You have no option -- MiniVend is unlikely to ever work on Windows NT.
There are a number of commercial programs available, and you might
someday find a freeware one.  But not MiniVend.
%%%
FAQ-ISP-Q09
%%
It still will not work.
%%
There is another wild-card. If your ISP doesn't use CGI-WRAP or another
program that runs your CGIs as your UID, and the VLINK or SVEND program
is not SUID, you will need to make your files world-readable and
writable (ugghh!) to make it work.  Set the ReadPermission and
WritePermission directives to 'world'.  (Also see the MiniVend web site
for a <A HREF="http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/bugs.html">patch</A> to the Server.pm in MiniVend 1.02).

FAQ-ISP-Q10
%%
MiniVend server only runs for a while, then dies.
%%
Many ISPs don't allow your user ID to run a program unless it is logged
in!  The moment a watchdog program notices a daemon running with a
non-logged-in UID, it terminates the program.  Or it terminates programs
that haven't been active for XX minutes.  Contact your ISP about this --
they may be able to do something for you.  
%%%
FAQ-SET-Q01
%%
Can I run multiple catalogs on one server?
%%
Yes, if you run multiple instances of the MiniVend server. The only
way is to install two complete MiniVend distributions, code and
all. Then all you need to do is rename the vlink executable to another
name and install it in the cgi-bin/ directory.

With disk space as cheap as it is, it didn't seem that saving the
200K or so of disk space was necessary. Memory is another consideration,
however, and if requests keep coming in, a feature to run multiple
catalogs from one server will probably be added.  Keep posted.
