news component               
===============

Description
-----------
This component enables the shop owner to easily add news items to the 
foundation catalog.
If you are already familiar with the merchandising components (eg. promo) 
you will notice that the news component has much resemblance (esp. the 
usage) with the promo component.


Installation
------------
In order to activate this feature, you have to copy the tree in the 
eg/news_feature directory to the appropriate directory of the foundation 
catalog.

	cp -r eg/news_feature path_to_your_catalogs/the_catalog

Restart the server after you have copied the files.

Examples
--------
A couple of sample news items are also provided to illustrate some 
features. To see them just point your browser to the news.html page.

The news page (news.html) can be accessed with:

	http://yourdomain.com/cgi-bin/you_catalog/news.html



Features
--------

- featured	used for categorisation purposes. One could use this

		different pages (different configuration of the news 
		component on different pages)
banner_text	Text could be used for banner display; not used in 
		sample data and sample page
banner_image	image to be displayed together with the news item

Files
-----
The directory structure of the news_feature directory has the same layout
as the foundation catalog directory. This should assist in
