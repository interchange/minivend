00001	general			Become an IC Pro...	...start with the tutorial!		20010804	20010804	20010301	Ton Verhagen	ton@verhagen.net		Interchange Tutorial	A new tutorial will familiarize you with many of the basic concepts of Interchange catalogs by leading you through the process of building a catalog from the ground up, all by hand. You'll create every directory and file yourself, and understand what each part does. When you're done, you'll have a very basic but working catalog, but more importantly, we hope you'll have learned a lot about Interchange. You can download it here in PDF format or <a href="http://www.icdevgroup.org/">read it on the developer site</a>.
