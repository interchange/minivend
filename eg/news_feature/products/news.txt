You'll create every directory and file yourself, and understand what each part does. When you're done, you'll have a very basic but working catalog, but more importantly, we hope you'll have learned a lot about Interchange. You can download it here in PDF format or <a href="http://interchange.redhat.com/cgi-bin/ic/dev/index">read it on the developer site</a>.
