# This module combines multiple sources of data into a single tied hash, so
# that they can all be queried simultaneously, the source of any given
# key-value pair irrelevant to the client script.  Data sources are searched
# in the order that they're added to the shadow hash.  Changes to the hashed
# data aren't propagated back to the actual data files; instead, they're
# saved within the tied hash and override any data obtained from the data
# sources.

=head1 NAME

Tie::ShadowHash - Merge multiple data sources into a hash

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    use Tie::ShadowHash;
    use DB_File;
    tie (%db, 'DB_File', 'file.db');
    $obj = tie (%hash, 'Tie::ShadowHash', \%db, "otherdata.txt");

    # Accesses search %db first, then the hashed "otherdata.txt".
    print "$hash{key}\n";

    # Changes override data sources, but don't change them.
    $hash{key} = 'foo';
    delete $hash{bar};

    # Add more data sources on the fly.
    %extra = (fee => 'fi', foe => 'fum');
    $obj->add (\%extra);

    # Add a text file as a data source, taking the first "word" up
    # to whitespace on each line as the key and the rest of the line
    # as the value.
    $split = sub { split (' ', $_[0], 2) };
    $obj->add ([text => "pairs.txt", $split]);

    # Add a text file as a data source, splitting each line on
    # whitespace and taking the first "word" to be the key and an
    # anonymous array consisting of the remaining words to be the
    # data.
    $split = sub { split (' ', $_[0]) };
    $obj->add ([text => "triples.txt", $split]);

=head1 DESCRIPTION

This module merges together multiple sets of data in the form of hashes into
a data structure that looks to Perl like a single simple hash.  When that
hash is accessed, the data structures managed by that shadow hash are
searched in order they were added for that key.  This allows the rest of a
program simple and convenient access to a disparate set of data sources.

Tie::ShadowHash can handle anything that looks like a hash; just give it a
reference as one of the additional arguments to tie().  This includes other
tied hashes, so you can include DB and DBM files as data sources for a
shadow hash.  If given a plain file name instead of a reference, it will
build a hash to use internally, with each chomped line of the file being the
key and the number of times that line is seen in the file being the value.

Tie::Shadowhash also supports special tagged data sources that can take
options specifying their behavior.  The only tagged data source currently
supported is "text", which takes a filename of a text file and a reference
to a sub.  The sub is called for every line of the file, with that line as
an argument, and is expected to return a list.  The first element of the
list will be the key, and the second and subsequent elements will be the
value or values.  If there is more than one value, the value stored in the
hash and associated with that key is an anonymous array containing all of
them.

Tagged data sources are distinguished from normal data sources by passing
them to tie() (or to add() -- see below) as an anonymous array.  The first
element is the data source tag and the remaining elements are arguments
for that data source.  For a text data source, see the usage summary above
for examples.

The shadow hash can be modified, and the modifications override the data
sources, but modifications aren't propagated back to the data sources.  In
other words, the shadow hash treats all data sources as read-only and saves
your modifications only in internal memory.  This lets you make changes to
the shadow hash for the rest of your program without affecting the
underlying data in any way (and this behavior is the main reason why this is
called a shadow hash).

If the shadow hash is cleared, by assigning the empty list to it, by
explicitly calling CLEAR(), or by some other method, all data sources are
dropped from the shadow hash.  There is no other way of removing a data
source from a shadow hash after it's been added (you can, of course, always
untie the shadow hash and dispose of the underlying object if you saved it
to destroy the shadow hash completely).

You can call the add() method of the underlying object to add data sources
to the shadow hash.  It takes the same arguments as the initial tie() does
and interprets them in the same way.

=head1 DIAGNOSTICS

=over 4

=item Can't open file %s: %s

Tie::ShadowHash was given a file name to use as a source, but when it tried
to open that file, the open failed with that system error message.

=item Invalid source type %s

Tie::Shadowhash was given a tagged data source of an unknown type.  The
only currently supported tagged data source is "text".

=head1 CAVEATS

It's worth paying B<very> careful attention to L<perltie/"The untie Gotcha">
when using this module.  It's also important to be careful about what you do
with tied hashes that are included in a shadow hash.  Tie::ShadowHash stores
a reference to such arrays; if you untie them out from under a shadow hash,
you may not get the results you expect.  Remember that if you put something
in a shadow hash, you'll need to clean out the shadow hash as well as
everything else that references a variable if you want to free it
completely.

Not all tied hashes implement EXISTS; in particular, ODBM, NDBM, some old
versions of GDBM, and versions of SDBM in Perl 5.005_56 or earlier don't.
Calling exists on a shadow hash that includes one of those tied hashes as a
data source may therefore result in a runtime error.  Tie::ShadowHash
doesn't use exists except to implement the EXISTS method because of this.

Because it can't use EXISTS due to the above problem, Tie::ShadowHash cannot
correctly distinguish between a non-existent key and an existing key
associated with an undefined value.  This isn't a large problem, since many
tied hashes can't store undefined values anyway, but it means that if one of
your data sources contains a given key associated with an undefined value
and one of your later data sources contains the same key but with a defined
value, when the shadow hash is accessed using that key, it will return the
first defined value it finds.  This is an exception to the normal rule that
all data sources are searched in order and the value returned by an access
is the first value found.  (Tie::ShadowHash does correctly handle undefined
values stored directly in the shadow hash.)
