NAME
    icrpm - Interchange RPM for Redhat Systems

  VERSION

    4.5.x

SYNOPSIS
    rpm -Uvh interchange-4.X.X-X.rpm

DESCRIPTION
    The Interchange 4 RPM is designed to integrate Interchange with a stock
    Redhat installation. It places logs and run files in fairly standard
    locations, i.e.:

    Configuration
        Configuration file is /etc/minivend.cfg. It is only writable by
        root.

    Data
        Catalog directories, at least the demos, are located in
        /var/lib/interchange.

    Invocation
        Invocation is the normal /etc/rc.d startup method. Interchange
        installs to be active in run levels 3, 4, and 5; to be killed in
        all.

        IMPORTANT NOTE: Do not expect /usr/local/interchange/bin/restart to
        work!

        Interchange uses a special invocation script, located at
        /usr/local/bin/interchange, to start the Interchange server. This is
        called by /etc/rc.d/init.d/interchange.

    Run Run files go in /var/run/interchange/*. The subdirectory is needed
        to allow the Interchange user ID to write/create files.

    Logs
        Logs go in /var/log/interchange/*. The subdirectory is needed to
        allow the Interchange user ID to write/create files.

ASSUMPTIONS
    The Interchange RPM makes several assumptions:

    Stock Apache
        Interchange relies upon the following things in the Apache
        installation:

         -- Server root in /home/httpd
         -- ScriptAlias /cgi-bin/ /home/httpd/cgi-bin/
         -- Hostname as revealed by `hostname` is the ServerName
         -- SuExec not enabled

        If you have SuExec enabled, you are responsible for changing
        permissions and running parameters appropriately. You can typically
        disable SuEXEC by running `chmod u-s /usr/bin/suexec'.

        If you want to continue to user suexec, you will have to compile the
        appropriate INET mode link program and use it instead of VLINK.

    Logs
        Logs are located in /var/log/interchange. Interchange drops a file
        in /etc/logrotate.d to do log rotation.

    Run files
        To place the logs, configuration, and run files in standard
        Redhat/LSB locations, Interchange relies on a special invocation
        from /usr/local/bin/interchange. In other words, don't expect
        /usr/local/interchange/bin/restart to work.

        Interchange will be started by this command:

            /etc/rc.d/init.d/interchange start

        and will be re-started by this command:

            /etc/rc.d/init.d/interchange restart

        or possibly:

            /usr/local/bin/interchange -r

        The run files, i.e. UNIX-domain socket, catalog status files, will
        be placed in /var/run/interchange. That directory must be
        owned/writable by the interchange user ID.

USING INTERCHANGE
    When the installation finishes, you should be able to access the two
    installed catalogs:

            http://localhost/barry/
            http://localhost/simple/

    The initial user name is "interchange", and the password is "pass".
    CHANGE IT.
