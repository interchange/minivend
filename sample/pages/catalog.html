<h1>Vend 0.1 Demo Catalog</h1>

Welcome to this demonstration of the Vend version 0.1 World Wide Web
catalog ordering system.  This is an alpha version, which means that
this program is still under development.<p>

Vend allows customers to select items to buy from catalog pages.  The
system tracks which items they have selected and the quantity desired.
From the ordering page they may complete the ordering process by
entering their name and address, or return to browsing and select more
items.<p>

Vend 0.1 does not support secure transmission of credit card numbers.
Vendors should contact customers separately via phone, fax, or regular
mail for payment.<p>
