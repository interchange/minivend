support for

mode, client-side imagemaps, user-customizable help and displays, and more.
This version of Vend includes an automatic configuration and installation
utility, and continues to be free under the GNU copyleft.

Frames, the new windowing technology
Netscape has proposed for HTML 3.0, significantly enhances the 
electronic catalog experience, letting the user maintain a 
context as they navigate through the catalog.
