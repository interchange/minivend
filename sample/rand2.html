<B>MiniVend Tech Tip</B>
<P>
Server mode is much faster than static mode. It means that the
MiniVend server runs in the background, ready and waiting to serve
pages.  A small, fast compiled CGI program (written in C) named
<I>vlink</I> routes the request to the server.
<P>
When running in static mode, with the <I>svend</I> CGI, Perl
must load MiniVend, read the configuration and messages (like this
one) and only then process the request. That is the reason
it is much slower.  You can improve static speed by using a 
minimum of features like <I>buttonbars, randoms, help messages,
custom colors</I> and <I>security</I>.
