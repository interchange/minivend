<B>MiniVend Tech Tip</B>
<P>
SSL security is now supported by MiniVend. It allows secure
input of sensitive information like credit cards. It is relatively
simple to use -- this demo has it enabled by default.  If you
have the demo up, but no secure server, edit the SecureURL directive
with MAT (or by changing <I>minivend.cfg</I>) and just use <I>http</I>
instead of <I>https</I> for the protocol specification. See the file
doc/minivend.html for more information.
