This document describes MiniVend 2.00, based on Andrew Wilcox's
original Vend, Version 0.2, with portions from Vend 0.3.

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
MiniVend allows customers to select items to buy from catalog pages. The
program tracks which products they have selected and the quantity
desired. From the ordering page they may complete the ordering process
by entering their name and address, or return to browsing and select
more items.  Once the order process is completed, MiniVend submits
the order to the system via email or an external order entry program.
<p>MiniVend plugs into a system with an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) server,
allowing encrypted transmission of sensitive customer data.  This
capability makes the entry of credit card numbers practical and secure.
<p>Many different catalogs can be run from the same MiniVend server,
allowing an ISP to serve many different customers from one or just
a few MiniVend server processes.
<p>Multiple servers can be run to serve the same set of catalogs, and
searches are forked. This ensures fast response while searching the
catalog.

The following sections briefly describe how MiniVend works.

<A NAME="minivend_how_0">
How MiniVend Manages Sessions</A>
</H2>
Normally, each request for a World Wide Web page which comes in to a
server stands on its own. While the server will probably know which
machine a request comes from, it may not know if the next request
comes from the same browser or even from the same user on that
machine.
<p>MiniVend keeps track of who is ordering what by including in the URL a
session id: a random string which is different for each customer
browsing the catalog.
<p>So that the session id can be included in URL's within catalog pages,
every page in the catalog is served up by MiniVend running as a cgi-bin
program. Here is an example of such a URL:
<p>
<XMP>
    http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1

As of Version 1.03, MiniVend now optionally supports 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_cookies_1"><EM>Cookies</EM></A>
, which.allows interspersal of regular HTML references and MiniVend page
references.
<p>Catalog pages are written in regular HTML with extensions to
support catalog ordering. Pages are delivered through the following
steps:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_the_0">
The HTTPD server receives a request for a catalog page.</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_the_1">
The server is already running as a daemon, and the request</A>

</STRONG>

causes a small C program called vlink. The vlink program
communicates with the MiniVend program
via a UNIX-domain socket. 
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_minivend_0">
MiniVend reads the HTML source page from the catalog pages directory,</A>

</STRONG>

and interprets the catalog ordering extensions in the file. If the

it is built ``on the fly'' using the template page flypage.html.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_the_2">

The MiniVend version described in this document is available from:
<p>
<XMP>
    http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/download.html

</XMP>
<p>If you are on a Solaris, or another UNIX which does not have native and
complete <EM>flock()</EM> support, you must also obtain the File::Lock module at
the same place that 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_perl_0">Perl</A>
 is available from.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_perl_0">
Perl</A>
</H2>
You will probably need Perl version 5.002 to run MiniVend 1.03. Many sites
are still running lower Perl versions. In addition, on systems that do not
have GDBM or DB_File installed, some of MiniVend's features (notably
DBM order and page access tracking) will not be available. Large catalogs
may be impossible to run due to memory limitations.
<p>You can download the latest Perl 5 from any CPAN (Comprehensive Perl

<A NAME="minivend_setup_0">
Setup for HTTP Servers</A>
</H2>
The most important issue with MiniVend is the permissions with
which the CGI program and the MiniVend server run.
<p>MiniVend uses a server running <EM>in the background</EM>, with a small
C program called 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
 that communicates with MiniVend via
a UNIX-domain socket.
<p>To improve security, MiniVend normally runs with the socket file
having 0600 permissions (rw-------), which mandates that the CGI
program and the server run <EM>as the same user ID</EM>. This means
that the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
 program must be SUID to the same user ID as
the server executes under.  (Or that CGIWRAP is used on a single
catalog system).
<p>With MiniVend 2.0 multiple catalog capability, the permissions
situation gets a bit tricky.  MiniVend comes with a program,
<EM>makecat</EM>, which configures catalogs for a multiple catalog
system. It should properly set up ownership and permissions
if run as the superuser.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="minivend_quick_0">
QUICK START</A>
</H1>
Before you begin, select the base directory where you want to install
MiniVend.  You can unpack the tar file either there, or in another
temporary directory -- the configure script handles either. The
suggested directory is /usr/local/lib/minivend -- but really any
directory will do.  You must of course have write permission there; and
you will eventually need to have write permission on your CGI-BIN
and HTML directories.
<p>If you plan on building multiple catalogs, you will probably want
separate directories to hold the catalog pages and databases. The 
<EM>makecat</EM> program supplied with MiniVend will make those for you.
<p>Decompress and untar the distribution:
<p>
<XMP>
    gzip -d mvend200.tar.gz
    tar xf mvend200.tar

</XMP>
<p>If you have GNU tar, you can combine these steps:
<p>
<XMP>
    tar xzf mvend200.tar.gz

</XMP>
<p>Before installing, check the site where you obtained MiniVend for any
patches that might have been issued since the release.
<p>Run the configure script with:
<p>
<XMP>
    ./configure

</XMP>
<p>If you have trouble with ./configure, try this:
<p>
<XMP>
    perl configure.pl /usr/bin/perl

</XMP>
<p>Replace the 'perl' and '/usr/bin/perl' with the proper paths to
your Perl 5 binary.
<p>The process should be self-explanatory. If you discover any problems,
refer to the section 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_if_0"><EM>If something goes wrong</EM></A>
. Otherwise,
MiniVend should be installed at the completion of the script.  It is
strongly suggested that you install the demo catalogs as a starting point for
your own catalog -- the configuration script will give you the
opportunity to do so.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> One point that is to be emphasized --
<EM>only your base html pages go in the document space of your http server.</EM>
Any pages with MiniVend elements/tags go in the directory set by the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pagedir_0"><EM>PageDir</EM></A>
 directive (the default is VendRoot/pages). For the demos
supplied with MiniVend, this means that only a few pages will be copied
to your HTML directory, with the remainder of the pages
staying in the directory defined as 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pagedir_0"><EM>PageDir</EM></A>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_setting_0">
Setting up multiple catalogs</A>
</H2>
MiniVend 2.0 now has multiple catalog capability.  It breaks
the configuration files into two pieces:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_minivend_cfg_0">
minivend.cfg</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This file is located in the main MiniVend directory, and
has only a few server-wide configuration parameters. The most
important is the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_2"><EM>Catalog</EM></A>
 directive, which sets up the
catalog configuration.  The sample 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
 supplied
with the distribution defines two catalogs:
<p>
<XMP>
 Catalog sample /home/catalogs/sample /cgi-bin/simple
 Catalog simple /home/catalogs/simple /cgi-bin/sample

</XMP>
<p>Additional parameters set up multi-server capability and
search parameters.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_catalog_cfg_0">
catalog.cfg</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Located in the directory where the individual catalog resides,
this file has most of the parameters which define the catalog.
<p>
</DL>
Each catalog can be completely independent, with different databases --.or catalogs can share any or all databases and session files.  This
means that several catalogs can share the same information, allowing
``virtual malls''.  Each catalog maintains its own pages and possibly its
own databases, but can easily share ordering information with other
storefronts.
<p>The steps to set up the multiple server capability are:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Install the MiniVend software. Use the supplied <EM>makecat</EM> program
to install the demo catalogs, 'sample' and 'simple'.  
<p>
<LI>Check the <EM>makecat.cfg</EM> file in the MiniVend
bin directory and make sure it fits your system.
It is especially important to have the MiniVendUser and
MiniVendGroup directives correct if you will have multiple
users configuring and running catalogs.
<p>
<LI>Select a name for your new catalog. The name will be
the default name for the HTML directory to be used, the
vlink executable, but it can be changed at configuration 
time.  For this example, our name is 'real'.
<p>
<LI>Run the makecat program:
	     
		    bin/makecat real
<p>
<LI>Answer the prompts, which should have much of the right
information by default if you have edited the makedemo.cfg
file properly. Reply yes when the makecat program asks if
you wish to place the catalog in minivend.cfg.
<p>
</OL>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_if_0">
If something goes wrong</A>
</H2>
First, check the README file, the FAQ and bug list at the official
MiniVend web site for information:
<p><A HREF="http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/mvend.html">http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/mvend.html</A>
<p>Second, double check that you have the following things:
<p>1. The 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
 program is SUID, or you have made appropriate
changes in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_readpermission_0"><EM>ReadPermission</EM></A>
 and <EM>WritePermission</EM> directives.
Unless the files are world-writable, the vlink program and
the MiniVend server must run as the same user ID!
<p>2. That you have proper file permissions. The program files
can be owned by anyone, but any databases, error logs, and
the directory that holds them must be writable by the proper
user ID.
<p>3. The vlink CGI program is being executed on a machine that has the
socket file <EM>etc/socket</EM> on a directly attached disk. UNIX-domain
sockets will not work on NFS-mounted filesystems!  That means the
server <EM>minivend.pl</EM> and the CGI program 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
 must be executing
on the same machine.
<p>If you have a problem you are not able to correct, you can send email
to:
<p>
<XMP>
    <mikeh@iac.net>

</XMP>
<p>Please include your <STRONG>operating system name</STRONG> and <STRONG>version</STRONG>, your

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_perl_0">Perl version</A>
 the <STRONG>DBM</STRONG> library in use, the minivend.cfg file, the
catalog.cfg file(s), and a directory listing of the MiniVend directory
(and its <EM>etc</EM> directory) <EM>after</EM> the attempt to run.  This can be
done by  leaving a message at the MiniVend bug reporting station:

<p>MiniVend is an ambitious and complex program, and is not presented as
being <EM>easy to use</EM>, <EM>easy to install</EM>, or <EM>bug-free</EM>.  The
configuration scripts were done to try and make a very painful process
only slightly painful.  Some people install in one pass.  Others never
make it, especially when they are running on an ISP.  Determined and
thoughtful users almost always make MiniVend work.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="minivend_setting_1">
SETTING UP YOUR CATALOG</A>
</H1>
MiniVend uses its own tags to implement catalog functions -- they
are similar to normal HTML, but are in [square brackets].  They
will be referred to as either <EM>tags</EM> or <EM>elements</EM> in this document.
<p>In order to set up a custom catalog, there are a number of steps.
<p>You will need to become familiar with the MiniVend tags and
directives to make your own catalog.  The demo catalogs are a good
starting point -- in particular we suggest you pay attention to the
order and search pages.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_start_0">
Start with a database</A>
</H2>
The first thing you must do is develop your product database. This might
contain all of the information used to display pages about your
products -- or just the product code (SKU), short description, and
price.  At the minimum, those three fields are required.
<p>Some other things you might put in:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_image_0">
image</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
A database field giving the name of an image file to display the
product. Alternatively, you can keep images in files that are named
for the product code -- then display them if they exist (use the
[if file file.gif] TAG [/if] construct).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_nontaxable_0">
nontaxable</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>

<A NAME="minivend_category_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
If you wish to do one-click category searches to build product

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_related_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>

</DL>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_on_the_fly_0">
On-the-fly pages, static, or both?</A>
</H2>
The on-the-fly page capability of MiniVend makes it easy to build
your catalog without hard-coding a single page. To build category
pages, use the one-click search.  To build single-item pages, use 
the flypage.html template and build your own.
<p>If you have a large catalog, you will almost certainly want to 
use the on-the-fly page for most products.  But if you want to
mix in a few extra-special pages, perhaps for your best sellers,
you can do so.  Just build the pages and place them in files corresponding
to the part number (in the MiniVend pages directory, of course -- not
your HTML directory).  They will take precedence over the on-the-fly
page.
<p>If you have only a small number of products, hard coded pages are
just fine.  Build them just about like normal HTML pages, except
for the MiniVend tags to order the item.  Place them whereever they
can be reached -- if you are using searches, you will want to 
name the file by the part number, or at least make a link to it.
<p>Some other things you might put in:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_images_0">

The demo catalogs supplied with MiniVend are there to give you a starting

etc.  
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_tree_0">

Determine how users will enter and exit your catalog. There are quite
complex and intelligent conditional schemes possible, especially if you

 capability, but simplicity is often the easiest and
most reliable.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="minivend_catalog_0">
CATALOG PAGES</A>
</H1>
Pages in the catalog are written in regular HTML with extensions to
support catalog ordering. To distinguish them from regular HTML, these
extended elements use square brackets instead of angular brackets.
<p>NOTE: As of MiniVend 1.03, there are no real distinctions between
order pages and other pages -- all may access the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_item_list_0">[item_list]</A>
 tag.
<p>The first page displayed in the catalog, if no argument is supplied
to the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
 or <EM>svend</EM> cgi-bin program, is ``catalog.html''. This page
will contain links to other catalog pages with the [page] element.
Individual products can be ordered by the [order &lt;item-code&gt;] element, which
brings up the order page ``order.html''. The order page contains input
boxes for the customer to type in their name and address. Once the
order has been sent the ``confirmation.html'' page is displayed.
<p>Unless you are using the ``cookie'' support, you will normally not want to
include regular hypertext links to pages outside of the catalog. Such
links will not include the session id, which means that if the customer
follows an external link back to the catalog the list of products
ordered so far will have been lost.
<p>Inline images, on the other hand, are served in the normal fashion.
You should include a regular &lt;IMG SRC=``URL''&gt; element, where the URL
refers to a graphic image.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_cookies_0">
Cookies</A>
</H2>
As of MiniVend 1.03, all you need to do to have users with cookie-capable
browsers retain session context is enable the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_cookies_1"><EM>Cookies</EM></A>
 directive.
You can then intermix standard HREF and MiniVend page links without
fear of losing the shopping basket.

<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_minivend_1">

The following elements can be used in catalog pages:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_page_0">
[page pg]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Insert a hyperlink to the specified catalog page pg. For
example, [page shirts] will expand into &lt;
a <A HREF="href=``http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1''>">href=``http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1''></A>. The
catalog page displayed will come from ``shirts.html'' in the
pages directory.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_pagetarget_0">
[pagetarget pg frame]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Same as the page element above, except it specifies an output frame to
target if frames are turned on.  The name <EM>is</EM> case-sensitive, and if
it doesn't exist a new window will be popped up.  This is the same as
the [page ...] tag if frames are not activated.
For example, [pagetarget shirts main] will expand into a link like &lt;a
<A HREF="href=``http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1''">href=``http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1''</A> TARGET=``main''&gt;. The
catalog page displayed will come from ``shirts.html'' in the
pages directory, and be output to the 'main' frame.  Be careful,
frame names are case-sensitive.
<p>This option also allows specification of secure pages if the target ends with
the string <EM>__secure</EM> (which will be stripped).  If so specified,
the page will be called with 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_secureurl_0"><EM>SecureURL</EM></A>
 instead of 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vendurl_0"><EM>VendURL</EM></A>
.

<A NAME="minivend_areatarget_0">

<p>The parameters are:
<p>
<XMP>
    width=nn        The column width, I<including the gutter>. Must be
                    supplied, there is no default.  A shorthand method
                    is to just supply the number as the I<first> parameter,
                    as in [col 20].
        
    gutter=n        The number of spaces used to separate the column (on

    wrap=(yes|no)   Determines whether text that is greater in length than
                    the column width will be wrapped to the next line. Default
                    is I<yes>.

<A NAME="minivend_minivend_2">
MiniVend Conditional HTML</A>
</H2>
To build complex order forms and reports, MiniVend supplies some conditional
capability with the [if ...] text [else] else-text [/else][/if]
construct.  It allows for testing for a condition within the Vend session,
and if true, inserting text and/or HTML. If the condition is not true, no
text (or the optional [else] text) will be inserted.
<p>This facility cannot be considered a language, for constructs cannot be
nested in a linear fashion, and operations cannot be performed (except
as side effects to the [if] tag).
<p>Starting with MiniVend 2.0, Perl code can be embedded directly in
the pages for additional control. This overcomes some of the limitations
of MiniVend conditional HTML.
<p><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> MiniVend interpolates tags in a highly ordered fashion, with
each tag having a precedence.  The order of the tag interpolation can
be changed by enclosing the tag in a set of double square brackets, bringing
it forward in the process.  The order of interpolation is:
<p>
<XMP>
  [[any tag]] item-list loop default value scratch calc if lookup set
  data file finish_order frames_on frames_off secure_order framebase
  body help buttonbar random rotate checked selected accessories field
  static pagetarget area areatarget page last_page perl order nitems
  discount subtotal shipping shipping_description salestax total_cost
  price description row process_order process_search process_target

</XMP>
<p>Most of the tests use Perl code, but MiniVend uses the Safe module with
its default restrictions to help ensure that improper code will not
crash the server or modify the wrong data.  There is nothing to be done
if your code enters an endless loop, though, and you have to use this
capability with caution.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_if_1">
[if type field op* compare*]</A>

</STRONG>

<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_session_0">

<DD>
The MiniVend session variables. Of particular interest
are <EM>login</EM>, 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_frames_0">frames</A>
, <EM>secure</EM>, and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_browser_0">browser</A>

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_config_0">

by the directives in your MiniVend configuration file (or
the defaults).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_value_0">
value</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The MiniVend user variables, typically set in search,
control, or order forms. Variables beginning with 'mv_'
are MiniVend special values, and should be tested/used
with caution.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_scratch_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
The MiniVend scratchpad variables, which can be set
with the [set name]value[/set] element. 
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_validcc_0">
validcc</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
A special case, takes the form [if validcc no type exp_date].
Evaluates to true if the supplied credit card number, type
of card, and expiration date pass a validity test.  Does
checksum digit calculation to weed out typos or phony 
card numbers.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_accessory_0">
accessory</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The accessories database.
<p>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The shipping database.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_salestax_0">
salestax</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The salestax database.
<p>
</DL>
The <EM>field</EM> term is the specifier for that area.  For example, [if session.frames] would return true if the 'frames' session parameter was set.
<p>As an example, consider buttonbars for frame-based setups.  It would be
nice to display a different buttonbar (with no frame targets) for sessions
that are not using frames:
<p>
<XMP>
    [if session frames]
        [buttonbar 1]
    [else]
        [buttonbar 2]
    [/else]
    [/if]

</XMP>
<p>Another example might be the when search matches are displayed. If
you use the string '[value mv_match_count] titles found', it will display
a plural for only one match.  Use:
<p>
<XMP>
    [if value mv_match_count != 1]
        [value mv_match_count] matches found.
    [else]
    [/else]
        Only one match was found.
    [/if]

</XMP>
<p>The <EM>op</EM> term is the compare operation to be used. Compare operations are
as in Perl:
<p>
<XMP>
    ==  numeric equivalence
    eq  string equivalence
    >   numeric greater-than
    gt  string greater-than
    <   numeric less-than
    lt  string less-than
    !=  numeric non-equivalence
    ne  string equivalence

</XMP>
<p>Any simple perl test can be used, including some limited regex matching (no
whitespace or conditionals can be contained in the comparison string). Discussion
of this is beyond the scope of this document.

save pages that a customer has seen -- perhaps for a rotating message.
A rotating message implementation is shown in the sample page

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_data_0">
[data area field key]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns the value of the field in any of the arbitrary databases,
or from the variable namespaces.  Databases will hide variables, so
don't name a database ``session'', ``scratch'', or any of the other
reserved names! Case is sensitive, so in a pinch you could call the
database ``Session'', but it would be better not to.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_loop_0">
[loop item,item,item] value [/loop]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Returns a string consisting of the value, repeated for every item in a
comma-separated list.  Operates in the same fashion as the [item-list]
tag, except for order-item-specific values. Intended to pull multiple
attributes from an item modifier -- but can be useful for other things,
like building a pre-ordained product list on a page.
<p>Limited to 1024 values in the list.

<p>
</DL>
The code can be as complex as desired, but cannot use any operators.that modify the filesystem or use ``unsafe'' operations like ``system'',
``exec'', or backticks.  These constraints are enforced with the default

DATABASES</A>
</H1>
MiniVend, as with most powerful shopping cart programs, is all about
databases.  
<p>This version of MiniVend implements the database in either GDBM,
DB_File, or in-memory format. If you use DBM, large catalogs can be used
without using too much memory or slowing down performance in static
mode.  The DBM files are built automatically when they change, from the
the ASCII source file. If the only DBM type on your system is NDBM, an
in-memory product database will be used. Catalogs of more than, say,
5,000 items will use large amounts of memory.
<p>MiniVend always uses DBM to manage sessions.  To effectively use
MiniVend, your system must have GDBM or DB_File support -- NDBM or
others will not normally work, as the 1024- or 4096-byte limitations on
key-value size will cause problems if your catalog is at all complex.
<p>MiniVend reads the data to place in the DBM files from standard
ASCII-delimited files. They can have ^M (carriage return) characters if
desired, but must have a newline character to work -- Mac users
uploading files must use ASCII mode, not binary mode!
<p>Three delimiter schemes are provided as standard:
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> The items must be separated by a <STRONG>single</STRONG> delimiter
character. The items are lined up for your reading convenience.

<A NAME="minivend_the_3">
The Products File</A>
</H2>
Each product you are selling should be given a product code: A short
code that identifies the product on the ordering page and in the
catalog. You can use any combination of letters, digits, dashes,
periods, pound signs, or underscores for the product code. The
<EM>products.asc</EM> file is a ASCII-delimited list of all the product codes,
along with an arbitrary number of fields which must contain at least the
fields 'description' and 'price' (or whatever you set the PriceField and
DescriptionField directives to).  Any additional information you want in
the catalog can be placed in any arbitrary field.
See <EM>MiniVend Database Capability</EM>for details on the format.
<p>Field names are case-sensitive. Unless you have fields with the names
``description'' and ``price'' field, you will have to appropriately set the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pricefield_0"><EM>PriceField</EM></A>
 and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_descriptionfield_0"><EM>DescriptionField</EM></A>

<A NAME="minivend_arbitrary_0">
Arbitrary Databases</A>

MiniVend can also manage an unlimited number of arbitrary databases.
They are in the same format as the products file by default, but
6 addressable schemes are available:
<p>
<XMP>
    Type 1      Default - same as products file (TAB, PIPE, or CSV)
    Type 2      Each field on its own line, a blank line or lines
                separates the record. Watch those carriage
                                returns!
    Type 3      Fields separated by a \n%%\n combination, records by

    Type 4      CSV
    Type 5      PIPE
    Type 6      TAB

</XMP>
<p>The databases are specified in

<A NAME="minivend_the_4">
THE SEARCH ENGINE</A>
</H1>
MiniVend implements a search engine which will search the product
database (or any other file) for items based on customer input.  It uses
the (example) query.html, results.html, helpquery.html, mvfaq.html,
and category.html files in the &lt;EM>sample/pages&lt;/EM> directory,
and has some of its own special tags and variables.
<p>Two search engine interfaces are provided, and four types of searching
are available.  The default is a text-based search of the
<EM>products.asc</EM> file.  A binary search of a dictionary-ordered file can
be specified.  An optional Glimpse search is enabled by placing
the command specification for Glimpse in the directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_glimpse_1"><EM>Glimpse</EM></A>
.
The last is a range-based search, best used in combination with
one of the above -- especially on large files.
<p>The default, a text based search, simply sequentially scans the
lines in the target file.  It returns the first field (delineated by
the standard 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_delimiter_0"><EM>Delimiter</EM></A>
), for every line matching the search specification.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_the_5">
The Search Form</A>
</H2>
A number of variables can be set on search forms to determine which search
will be used, and what fields in the database it will search.
Here is a simple search form:
<p>
<XMP>
        <FORM ACTION="[process-search]" METHOD=POST>
        <INPUT TYPE="text" SIZE="30" NAME="mv_searchspec">
        <INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="mv_todo" VALUE="Search">
        </FORM>

</XMP>
<p>When the ``Search'' submit button is pressed (or &lt;ENTER&gt; is pressed)
MiniVend will search the <EM>products.asc</EM> file for the string entered
into the text field 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_searchspec_0">mv_searchspec</A>
, and return the product
code pertaining to that line.
<p>The same search for a fixed string, say ``shirt'', could be performed with
the use of a hot link, using the special <EM>scan</EM> URL:
<p>
<XMP>
    [page scan/se=search]See our shirt collection![/page]

</XMP>
<p>The default is to search every field on the line.
If you only wished to match on the string shirt in the product
database field ``description'', you could modify the search:
<p>
<XMP>
    <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mv_search_field" VALUE="description">

</XMP>
<p>If you want to let the user decide on the search parameters, you can
use checkboxes or radiobox fields to set the fields:
<p>
<XMP>
    Search by author
       <INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="mv_search_field" VALUE="author">
    Search by title
        <INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="mv_search_field" VALUE="title">

</XMP>
<p>Fields can be stacked -- if more than one is checked, all checked fields
will be searched. (This doesn't work for Glimpse in the return_file_name
mode, though).
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_glimpse_0">
Glimpse</A>
</H2>
<STRONG>To use the Glimpse search</STRONG>, you must build the Glimpse index based on
files in your 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_productdir_0"><EM>ProductDir</EM></A>
, or wherever the files to be searched will
be located. If you installed MiniVend in the default
<EM>/usr/local/lib/minivend</EM>, the command line to build the index for the
products file would be:
<p>
<XMP>
    glimpseindex -b -H /usr/local/lib/minivend/products products.asc

</XMP>
<p>There are several ways to improve search speed for large catalogs.
<p>One method that works well for large <EM>products.asc</EM> files is to split
the <EM>products.asc</EM> file into small index files (in the example, 100
lines) with the split(1) UNIX command, then index it with glimpse:
<p>
<XMP>
    split -100 products.asc index.asc.
    glimpseindex -H /usr/local/lib/minivend/products index.asc.*

</XMP>
<p>This will dramatically increase search speeds for large catalogs, at
least if the search term is relatively unique. If it is a common string,
as you might have in a category search, you will be better off to use
the text-based search.
<p>If the Glimpse executable is not found at MiniVend startup, the Glimpse
search will be disabled and the regular text-based search used instead.
<p>There are several things you have to watch for while using <STRONG>glimpse</STRONG>,
and a liberal dose of the Glimpse documentation is suggested. In particular,
the spelling error capability will not work in combination with the
field-specific search -- Glimpse selects the line, but MiniVend's
text-based search routines disqualify it when checking to see if the
search string is within one of the specified fields.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_fast_0">
Fast Binary Search</A>
</H2>
<STRONG>Fast binary searching</STRONG> is useful for scanning large databases for
strings that match the beginning of a line.  They use the standard
Perl module Search::Dict, and are enabled through use of the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_look_0">mv_dict_look</A>
,

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_end_0">mv_dict_end</A>
, 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_limit_0">mv_dict_limit</A>
, 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_fold_0">mv_dict_fold</A>
, and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_order_0">mv_dict_order</A>

variables.
<p>The search must be done on a <STRONG>dictionary-ordered</STRONG> pre-built index.
<p>See the documentation for Vend::Search for more information. (From the
MiniVend root directory, you can see it by using ``perldoc Vend::Search''.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_range_0">
Range Searching</A>
</H2>
Range searching allows you to qualify your search returns with a field
that must be within a certain numeric or alphanumeric range.  To use it,
set the mv_range_look variable to the products database field, or a
column/field number for another file.  Then set the corresponding

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_range_min_0">mv_range_min</A>
 and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_range_max_0">mv_range_max</A>
 variables with a selectable field.
<p>
<XMP>
        <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mv_range_look" VALUE="price">
        Search on Price
    Min <SELECT NAME="mv_range_min">
             <OPTION value=0 SELECTED> Any
             <OPTION value=1000000> $1,000,000
             <OPTION value=10000000> $10,000,000
             <OPTION value=20000000> $20,000,000
             <OPTION value=40000000> $40,000,000
        </SELECT><BR>
    Max <SELECT NAME="mv_range_max">
            <OPTION value=0 SELECTED> no object
            <OPTION value=1000000> $1,000,000
            <OPTION value=10000000> $10,000,000
            <OPTION value=20000000> $20,000,000
            <OPTION value=40000000> $40,000,000
        </SELECT>

</XMP>
<p>The value of 0 for mv_range_max is equivalent to infinity if doing a
numeric search. (This makes it impossible to search for a ceiling of 0
with a negative mv_range_min, just in case you were planning on trying
that.)
<p>The fields are stackable, so you can set more than one range to
check.  The order is significant, in the sense that the array
of field names and minimum/maximum values must be kept in order
to achieve correspondence.
<p>The optional 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_range_alpha_0">mv_range_alpha</A>
 specification allows alphanumeric range
matching for the corresponding field -- if it is set, and you have
stacked the fields, they must all be set.  The 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_case_0">mv_case</A>
 field does
apply if it is set -- otherwise the comparison is without regard to
case.
<p>If you wish to do ONLY a range search, you must select all lines
with <EM>mv_return_all</EM>=yes in order to make the search operate. Range-only
searches will be quite slow for large databases, since every line
must be scanned.  It should be quite usable for catalogs of less than
100,000 items in size, given a fast machine.  Using it in combination
with another search technique will yield quite quick results.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_one_click_0">
One-click searches</A>
</H2>
MiniVend allows you to pass a search in a URL.  Just specify the
search with the special page reference <EM>scan</EM>.  Here is an
example:
<p>
<XMP>
         [page scan/se=Impressionists/sf=category]
                Impressionist Paintings
         [/page]

</XMP>
<p>Here is the same thing from a home page (assuming /cgi-bin/vlink is
the CGI path for MiniVend's vlink):
<p>
<XMP>
         <A HREF="/cgi-bin/vlink/scan/se=Impressionists/sf=category">
                Impressionist Paintings
         </A>

</XMP>
<p>The two-letter abbreviations are mapped with these letters:
<p>
<XMP>
 ac  mv_all_chars          mp  mv_profile                   
 bd  mv_base_directory     ms  mv_min_string       
 co  mv_coordinate         os  mv_orsearch
 cs  mv_case               ra  mv_return_all
 de  mv_dict_end           rd  mv_return_delim
 df  mv_dict_fold          rf  mv_return_fields
 di  mv_dict_limit         rg  mv_range_alpha
 dl  mv_dict_look          rl  mv_range_look
 do  mv_dict_order         rm  mv_range_min
 dr  mv_record_delim       rn  mv_return_file_name
 em  mv_exact_match        rs  mv_return_spec

 hs  mv_head_skip          sf  mv_search_field
 id  mv_index_delim        sp  mv_search_page
 ml  mv_matchlimit         st  mv_searchtype
 mm  mv_max_matches        su  mv_substring_match

</XMP>
<p>They can be treated just the same as form variables on the
page, except that they can't contain spaces, '/' in a file
name, or quote marks.  These characters can be used, but only
in URL decimal encoding, i.e. &amp;#32; is a space, &amp;#47 is a
<CODE>/</CODE>, etc. -- <CODE>&amp;sp;</CODE> will not be recognized.
<p>So if you wish to do an OR search on the fields category and artist
for the strings ``Surreal'' and ``Gogh'', while matching substrings,
you would do:
<p>
<XMP>
 [page scan/se=Surreal/se=Gogh/os=yes/su=yes/sf=artist/sf=category]
        Van Gogh -- compare to surrealists
 [/page]

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_search_1">
Search Profiles</A>
</H2>
You can predefine an unlimited number of search profiles that reside
in a file or files.  To use this, make up a series of lines like:
<p>
<XMP>
 mv_searchfield=artist
 mv_searchfield=category
 mv_orsearch=yes

</XMP>
<p>and place them in a file.  Define the file name in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_searchprofile_0">SearchProfile</A>

directive. Re-start the server.  The profiles are numbered in the 
order found (not by file name), starting at 0,  and are available by
setting the variable mv_profile to the number of the profile.
<p>The special variable <EM>mv_last</EM> stops interpretation of search
variables.  The following variables are always interpreted:
<p>
<XMP>
        mv_dict_look
        mv_searchspec
        mv_range_look
        mv_range_min
        mv_range_max

</XMP>
<p>Other than that, if you set mv_last in a search profile, and there
are other variables on the search form, they will not be interpreted.
<p>The search profiles are also available, and especially useful, for
one-click searches.  They are available by setting scan/mp=n/se=text,
where n is the number of the profile.
<p>If you want to place multiple search profiles in the same file,
separate them with __END__, which must be on a line by itself.
Be careful, then they are interpreted in the order found, with 
the second file name not necessarily being the second profile (which
would be numbered 1).

from.  File names without leading / characters will be based from
there.  In the Glimpse search, passed to Glimpse with the <CODE>-H</CODE> option,
and Glimpse will look for its indices there. Default is ProductDir.

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_case_0">
mv_case</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
If this item is set to <EM>yes</EM>, the search will return items without regard
to upper or lower case.  This is the default -- set to <EM>yes</EM> if case
should be matched.  Implement with a checkbox &lt;INPUT TYPE=CHECKBOX&gt; field.

matching will stop. Ignored without mv_dict_look.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_dict_limit_0">
mv_dict_limit</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Automatically set the limiting string (mv_dict_end) to be one character
greater than the mv_dict_look variable, at the character position
specified.  A value of 1, for instance, will set the limiting string
to ``fprsythe'' if the value of 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_look_0">mv_dict_look</A>
 is ``forsythe''.  A useful
value is -1, which will increment the last character (setting the 
mv_dict_end to ``forsythf'' in our example).  This prevents having
to scan the whole file once a unique match is found.
<p>The order of this and the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_end_0">mv_dict_end</A>

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_matchlimit_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
The page size for matches that are returned.  If more matches than

</STRONG>
<DD>
Selects one of the pre-defined search specifications set by the

<EM>mv_last</EM>, is defined, it will prevent the scanning of the form input
for further search modifications.  The values of 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_searchspec_0">mv_searchspec</A>
 and

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_look_0">mv_dict_look</A>

while still reading the search input text.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_range_alpha_0">
mv_range_alpha</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Sets the type of match, numeric or alphanumeric,  for the range search

it is greater than the mv_range_min specification) if the field searched
is less than or equal to mv_range_max, in an alphanumeric sense.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_range_look_0">
mv_range_look</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This sets a field to scan for a range of numbers.  It must be
accompanied with corresponding mv_range_min and mv_range_max variables.
It can be a products file field name, if the search is in the products

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_range_max_0">
mv_range_max</A>

<DD>
Sets the high bound for the range search in its corresponding 
range field.  The search will return true (assuming it is greater than
the mv_range_min specification) if the field searched is less than or
equal to mv_range_max. To set the bound at infinity, or whatever your
integer limit is, set mv_range_min to 0.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_range_min_0">
mv_range_min</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Sets the low bound for the range search in its corresponding

the mv_range_max specification) if the field searched is less than or
equal to mv_range_min.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_return_fields_0">
mv_return_fields</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The fields that should be returned by the match. You should
not normally set this, as the default of field 0 only 
works well with MiniVend's key-based database method of
displaying search pages.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_search_field_0">
mv_search_field</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The search field(s) to be searched, specified in one of two ways.
If the field is in the products database, it can be specified by
field name.  If in an arbitrary database, it must be specified by
row number (code cannot be specified).
<p>If the number of instances matches the number of fields specified in the
mv_searchspec variable, and mv_coordinate is set to true, each search
field (in order specified on the form) will be matched with each search
spec (again in that order).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_search_file_0">
mv_search_file</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
In the text search, set this variable to the file(s) to be scanned
for a match.  The default, if not set, is to scan the products.asc
file. If set multiple times in a form (for a text search), will cause a
search all the files. One file name per instance.
<p>In the Glimpse search, follows the Glimpse wildcard-based file name
matching scheme.  Use with caution and a liberal dose of the Glimpse
man page.

<A NAME="minivend_mv_search_over_msg_0">
mv_search_over_msg</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The message that should be displayed if there is an overflow
condition (max_matches is exceeded). Overrides the SearchOverMsg
directive -- it is cleared by MiniVend if there is no overflow.
Somewhat deprecated by match paging.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_search_page_0">
mv_search_page</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The MiniVend-style name of the page that should display the search
results.  Overrides the FrameSearchPage directive, and the default
value of 'search'.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_searchspec_0">
mv_searchspec</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The actual search string that is typed in by the customer. It is 
a text INPUT TYPE=TEXT field, or can be put in a select (drop-down)
list to enable category searches. If multiple instances are found,
they will be concatenated just as if multiple words had been 
placed in a text field.
<p>The user can place quotes around words to specify that they match
as a string. To enable this by default, use the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_exact_match_0">mv_exact_match</A>

variable.
<p>If 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_look_0">mv_dict_look</A>
 has a value, and mv_searchspec does <STRONG>not</STRONG>, then
mv_searchspec will be set to the value of mv_dict_look.
<p>If the number of instances matches the number of fields specified in the
mv_search_field variable, and mv_coordinate is set to true, each search
field (in order specified on the form) will be matched with each search
spec (again in that order).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_searchtype_0">
mv_searchtype</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
If set to <EM>glimpse</EM>, selects the Glimpse search (if Glimpse is defined).
If set to <EM>text</EM>, selects the text-based search. Defaults to <EM>text</EM> if

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_glimpse_1"><EM>Glimpse</EM></A>
 is not defined, to Glimpse if it is. This can allow use of
both search types if that is desirable -- for instance, searching for
very common strings is better done by the text-based search. An example
might be searching for categories of items instead of individual items.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_spelling_errors_0">
mv_spelling_errors</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The number of spelling errors that will be tolerated. Ignored unless
using Glimpse. If you have a large catalog, you might wish to limit this
to two.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_substring_match_0">
mv_substring_match</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
If mv_substring_match is  set to <EM>yes</EM>, matches on substrings as well
as whole words. You would typically want to set this for dictionary-based
searches.
<p>
</DL>
The sample search page also has a link to a help file <EM>(pages/help.html)</EM>.which has rudimentary end-user help for the search engine.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_the_6">
The Results Page</A>
</H2>
Once a search has been done, there needs to be a way of presenting
the output.  By default, the special page search.html is used -- but
any number of search pages can be specified by passing the value in
the search form, specified in the variable 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_search_page_0">mv_search_page</A>
.
<p>On the search page, some special MiniVend tags are used to format
the otherwise standard HTML.  Each of the iterative tags is
applied to every code returned from the search -- this is normally
the product code, but could be a key to any of the arbitrary
databases. The value placed by the [item-code] tag is set to whatever
the first field (separated by whitespace) is, at least when the 
default of <STRONG>yes</STRONG> is in the UseCode directive. 
<p>NOTE: The special item tags (item_price, item_data, item_accessory,
etc.) still refer to fields in the product database. To access arbitrary
databases, you will need to use the idiom [data database field [item_code]].
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_search_list_0">
[search_list]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Starts the representation of a search list. MiniVend tags can be
embedded in the search list, yielding a table or formatted
list of items with part number, description, price, and  hyperlinks to
order or go to its catalog page. 
<p>In particular, all of the item tags described under order page
are active.  The most useful one might be [item_link], which if
properly used, can allow the user to search the catalog for
an item, then click a link to go to detailed catalog page
for the item. See the sample search.html page for an example.
<p>In fact, any of the MiniVend database access tags can be used,
allowing you to pull data from any of the fields in any of
your predefined databases.  Along with the MiniVend conditional
tags, very complex pages can be built for each individual item
returned in the search.

<p>The current page will not be a hyperlink.  Every time the new

THE ORDER PROCESS</A>

The order page(s) are where the items are tracked and adjusted by the
customer.  It is possible, beginning with MiniVend 1.03, to have an
unlimited number of order pages.  This allows a basket/checkout type
of ordering scheme, with custom order pages for items which have
many accessories.
<p>The name of the page to display can be configured in several
ways:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Set the SpecialPage 'order' to the page to display
when an item is ordered.
<p>
<LI>Set the FrameOrderPage directive to the page to use
when frames are enabled. This overrides option 1.
<p>
<LI>Use the [order item page] Order it! [/order] form of
order tag to specify an arbitrary order page for an item.
<p>
<LI>If already on an order page, set the mv_checkout, mv_orderpage,
mv_nextpage, mv_successpage, or mv_errorpage variables.
<p>The variables mentioned above modify the page display in the
following ways:
<p>
<LI>Page to be displayed on a refresh

<LI>Page to be displayed when checkout is called from the form

The Accessories database is a place to keep conditional accessory.items for display on the order page (or anywhere else, for that matter).
This allows you to place additional conditional items on the order page,
perhaps checkboxes or a drop-down menu to select a color or style. Or
you can have whole conditional trees to automatically configure a product
to a customer's needs.
<p>The structure of the Accessories database is a simple key-value pair --
if you have more complex accessory setups you can define one of the

</H2>
An unlimited number of order checking profiles can be defined
with the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_orderprofile_0"><EM>OrderProfile</EM></A>
 directive. This allows a multi-level ordering
process, with checking for format and validity at every stage.
<p>Specifications take the form of an order page variable (like name
or address), followed by an equals sign and one of five check types:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_required_1">
required</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
A non-blank value is required
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mandatory_0">
mandatory</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Must be non-blank, and must have been specified on this
form, not a saved value from a previous form
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_phone_0">
phone</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The field must look like a phone number, by a very
loose specification allowing numbers from all countries
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_phone_us_0">
phone_us</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Must have US phone number formatting, with area code
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_email_0">
email</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Rudimentary email address check, must have an '@' sign,
a name, and a minimal domain
<p>
</DL>
Also, there are three pragmas that can be used to change behavior:.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>&amp;fatal</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Set to '&amp;fatal=yes' if an error should generate
the error page
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>&amp;final</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Set to '&amp;final=yes' if a successful check should
cause the order to be placed
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>&amp;set</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Set a minivend variable to a value, i.e.
&amp;set=mv_email [value email]. This is usually
placed at the end after a &amp;fatal pragma would
have caused the process to stop if there was an
error
<p>
</DL>
As an added measure of control, the specification is evaluated with the.special MiniVend tags to provide conditional setting of order
parameters. With the new [perl] [/perl] capability, quite complex checks
can be done.  Also, the name of the page to be displayed on an error
can be set in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_errorpage_0">mv_errorpage</A>
 variable.
<p>The following file specifies a simple check of formatted parameters:
<p>
<XMP>
 name=required
 address=required
 city=required
 state=required
 zip=required
 email=required
 phone_day=phone_us
 &fatal=yes
 email=email
 &set=mv_email [value email]
 &set=mv_successpage ord/shipping

</XMP>
<p>The profile above only performs the &amp;set directives if all of the
previous checks have passed -- the &amp;fatal=yes will stop processing after
the check of the email address if any of the previous checks failed.
<p>If you want to place multiple order profiles in the same file,
separate them with __END__, which must be on a line by itself.
Be careful, then they are interpreted in the order found, with 
the second file name not necessarily being the second profile.
(Which would be numbered 1, of course, just for clarity. At least
it is clear to a programmer.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_simple_0">
Simple Order Report File</A>
</H2>
The simple order report file, ``report'', defines the layout of the order
report which gets mailed on the completion of the order. For example,
<p>
<XMP>
              Order Date: $date
                    Name: $name
           Email address: $email
        Shipping address: $addr
        Town, State, Zip: $town, $state $zip
                 Country: $country

</XMP>
<p>Any input field from the order page can be included using the dollar
sign notation.
<p>To prevent a value from being included in the order report, just add it
to the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_reportignore_0">ReportIgnore</A>
 configuration directive.  
<p>MiniVend defines some values for use in the search form -- they begin
with 'mv_' and are automatically ignored.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_fully_configurable_0">
Fully-configurable Order Reports</A>
</H2>
You can specify a fully-configurable order report by setting the hidden
field ``mv_order_report'' to a legal MiniVend page. This page will be
interpolated with all MiniVend tags before sending by email.  The order
number as set by backend ordering is in the variable mv_order_number,
and available for your use.
<p>You could if you wish include HTML in the file, which will be interpreted
by many mailers, but you can choose to use standard ASCII format.
An example report is provided in the demo file &lt;pages/ord/report.html&gt;.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_order_3">
Order Receipts</A>
</H2>
If you specify a legal MiniVend page name in the ReceiptPage directive,
the user will be sent this page instead of the default ``confirmation.html''
file.  The file can of course be configured with all MiniVend tags, and
will be interpolated for the ordered items before they are deleted from
the user record.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_the_8">
The Order Counter</A>
</H2>
An order counter can be enabled if the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_ordercounter_0"><EM>OrderCounter</EM></A>
 directive
is set to a file name.  An incrementing count of all orders will be
kept and assigned as orders are placed.  By default, the number
starts at 0, but you can edit the file and change the default
starting number at any time.
<p>This capability is made possible by the File::CounterFile module,
available (as a part of the fine libwww modules) at the same place you
got MiniVend.  It is included with the distribution.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_customer_0">
Customer Input Fields</A>
</H2>
On the order (or shopping basket) page, by default order.html, you will
have a number of input fields allowing customer to enter information
such as their name and address.  You can add more fields simply by
putting more input elements on the order.html page, and the information
will automatically be included in the order report. Input elements
should be written in this way:
<p>
<XMP>
    <input type="text" name="town" value="[value town]" size=30>

</XMP>
<p>Choose a name for this input field such as ``email'' for an email
address. Set the name attribute to the name you have chosen.
<p>The value attribute specifies the default value to give the field when
the page is displayed. Because the customer may enter information on
the order page, return to browsing, and come back to the order page,
you want the default value to be what was entered the first time. This
is done with the [value] element, which returns the last value of an
input field. Thus,
<p>
<XMP>
    value="[value name]"

</XMP>
<p>will evaluate to the name entered on the previous order screen, such
as:
<p>
<XMP>
       value="Jane Smith"

</XMP>
<p>which will be displayed by the browser.
<p>The size attributes specifies how many characters wide the input field
should be on the browser. You do not need to set this to fit the
longest possible value since the browser will scroll the field, but
you should set it large enough to be comfortable for the customer.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="minivend_item_0">
ITEM ATTRIBUTES</A>
</H1>
MiniVend allows item attributes to be set for each ordered item. This
allows a size, color, or other modifier to be attached to a common
part number.  If multiple attributes are set, then they should be
separated by commas.  Previous attribute values can be saved by means
of a hidden field on a form, and new attributes stacked on top of
each other.
<p>The configuration file directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_usemodifier_0"><EM>UseModifier</EM></A>
 is used to set
the name of the modifier or modifiers. For example
<p>
<XMP>
    UseModifier        size,color

</XMP>
<p>will attach both a size and color attribute to each item code that
is ordered.
<p>The modifier value is accessed in the [item-list] loop with the
[item-modifier attribute] tag, and form input fields are placed with the
[modifier-name attribute] tag.  This is similar to the way that quantity
is handled, except that attributes can be ``stacked'' by setting multiple
values in an input form.
<p>Use the [loop item,item,item] list to reference multiple display or
selection fields for modifiers. The modifier value can then be used to
select data from an arbitrary database for attribute selection and
display.
<p>You cannot define a modifier name of <EM>quantity</EM>, as that is already
used.  You must be sure that no fields in your forms are the same
name as the attribute name you select, 
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_product_0">
Product Discounts</A>
</H2>
Product discounts can be set upon display of any page. The discounts
apply only to the customer receiving them, and are of one of three types:
<p>
<XMP>
    1. A discount for one particular item code (key is the item-code)
    2. A discount applying to all item codes (key is ALL_ITEMS)
    3. A discount applied after all items are totaled
       (key is ENTIRE_ORDER)

</XMP>
<p>The discounts are specified via a formula. The formula is scanned for
the variables <STRONG>$q</STRONG> and <STRONG>$s</STRONG>, which are substituted for with the item
<EM>quantity</EM> and <EM>subtotal</EM> respectively. In the case of the item and
all items discount, the formula must evaluate to a new subtotal for all
items <EM>of that code</EM> that are ordered. The discount for the entire
order is applied to the entire order, and would normally be a monetary
amount to subtract or a flat percentage discount.
<p>Discounts are applied to the effective price of the product, including
any quantity discounts.
<p>To apply a straight 20<STRONG>% </STRONG>discount to all items:
<p>
<XMP>
    [discount ALL_ITEMS] $s * .8 [/discount]

</XMP>
<p>To take 25<STRONG>% </STRONG>off of only item 00-342:
<p>
<XMP>
    [discount 00-342] $s * .75 [/discount]

</XMP>
<p>To subtract <STRONG>$5</STRONG>.00 from the customer's order:
<p>
<XMP>
    [discount ENTIRE_ORDER] $s - 5 [/discount]

</XMP>
<p>Perl code can be used to apply the discounts.  Here is an example of a
discount for item code 00-343 which prices the <EM>second</EM> one ordered at
1 cent:
<p>
<XMP>
    [discount 00-343]
    return $s if $q == 1;
    my $p = $s/$q;
    my $t = ($q - 1) * $p;
    $t .= 0.01;
    return $t;
    [/discount]

</XMP>

<H1> 
<A NAME="minivend_sales_0">
SALES TAX</A>
</H1>
MiniVend allows calculation of sales tax on a straight percentage basis,
with certain items allowed to be tax-exempt.  To enable this feature,
the directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_salestax_2"><EM>SalesTax</EM></A>
 is initialized with the name of a field (or
fields) on the order form.  Commonly, this is zipcode and/or state:
<p>
<XMP>
    SalesTax    zip,state

</XMP>
<p>This being done, MiniVend assumes the presence of a file 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_salestax_asc_0">salestax.asc</A>
,
which contains a database with the percentages.  Each line of 

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_salestax_asc_0">salestax.asc</A>
 should be a code (again, usually a five-digit zip or
a two letter state) followed by a tab, then a percentage. Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    default 0
    45056   .0525
    61821   .0725
    61801   .075
    IL      .0625
    OH      .0525
    WA      .08

</XMP>
<p>Based on the user's entry of information in the order form, MiniVend
will look up (for our example SalesTax directive) first the zip, then
the state, and apply the percentage to the SUBTOTAL of the order.  The
subtotal will include any taxable items, and will also include the
shipping cost if the state/zip is included in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_taxshipping_0"><EM>TaxShipping</EM></A>
 directive.
It will add the percentage, then make that available with the [salestax]
tag for display on the order form. If no match is found, the entry
'default' is applied -- that is normally 0, but can be anything.
<p>If business is being done on a national basis, it is now common to have
to collect sales tax for multiple states.  If you are doing so, it is possible
to subscribe to a service which issues regular updates of the sales tax
percentages -- usually by quarterly or monthly subscription.  Such a
database should be easily converted to MiniVend format -- but some systems
are rather convoluted, and it will be well to check and see if the
program can export to a flat ASCII file format based on zip code.
<p>If some items are not taxable, then you must set up a field in your
database which indicates that. You then place the <STRONG>name</STRONG> of that field
in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_nontaxablefield_0"><EM>NonTaxableField</EM></A>
 directive. If the field for that item
evaluates true on a yes-no basis (i.e. is set to 'yes', 'y', 1, or the
like), sales tax will not be applied to the item. If it evaluates false,
it will be taxed.
<p>If your state taxes shipping, use the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_taxshipping_0"><EM>TaxShipping</EM></A>
 directive.
Utah and Nevada are known to tax shipping -- there may be others.
<p><p><hr>

<A NAME="minivend_shipping_1">
SHIPPING</A>
</H1>
MiniVend allows the addition of a flat shipping charge with
the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_shipping_2"><EM>Shipping</EM></A>
 directive.  Most catalogs have more elaborate
requirements, requiring use of the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_custom_0"><EM>Custom Shipping</EM></A>

of MiniVend.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_custom_0">

MiniVend allows custom shipping charges to be added to an order based on

the default field to use in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_customshipping_0"><EM>CustomShipping</EM></A>
 directive:
<p>
<XMP>
    CustomShipping  weight

</XMP>
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> Before MiniVend 2.0, there could only be one field used to set
the criteria.  As of MiniVend 2.0, the entry in the shipping file
which is <EM>exactly the same</EM> as the value of the mv_shipmode variable
will be used to determine the field criteria for the shipping method.
This allows <EM>weight</EM> to be used for one mode, while <EM>price</EM> or
<EM>quantity</EM> is used for another.
<p>The shipping cost database (located in ProductDir/shipping.asc)
is a tab-separated ASCII file with six fields --

</XMP>
<p>If the user selected RPS, (code RPSG), and the quantity on the order
was 3, the cost of 7.00 from <EM>rpsg1</EM> would be applied.  If the
quantity were 7, the next entry from <EM>rpsg2</EM> would be selected, for a
cost of 10.00.  If the quantity were 15, <EM>rpsg3</EM> would be selected, and
the quantity of 15 multiplied by 0.95, for a total cost of 14.25.
<p>The second one is a more complicated formula -- using price as the
criteria. 
<p>The third is a special case. It specifies a UPS lookup based on three 
things:
<p>
<XMP>
        1. Your UPS zone
        2. Weight (careful, always use weight for this one!)
        3. The zip/postal code of the recipient

</XMP>
<p>The routines use standard UPS lookup tables.  First, the UPS Zone file
must be present.  That is a standard UPS document, <EM>specific to your area</EM>,
that you must obtain from UPS and enter into and make available
to MiniVend in TAB-delimited format. You specify it with the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_upszonefile_0"><EM>UpsZoneFile</EM></A>
 directive. Second, you must obtain the cost tables from
UPS (you can get them from www.ups.com) and place them into a MiniVend
database. That database, selected with the first argument (upsg in the
example) of the cost specification, is consulted to determine the UPS
cost for that weight and zip code.  See the sample demo, which has a
functional implementation, for more information.
<p>Note that the first entry in each class does not have a number appended
to it.  That is the entry used to determine the criteria (quantity, weight,
price, etc. It is also used to apply the cost if the value of the criteria
is less than 1.

<A NAME="minivend_tracking_0">
TRACKING AND BACKEND ORDER ENTRY</A>
</H1>
MiniVend has a tracking  option, enabled with the configuration
directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_tracking_1"><EM>Tracking</EM></A>
.  Entered orders and page popularity are tracked.
The tracking database is also used to hold encrypted data such as credit
card numbers, expiration dates, and the encrypted MiniVend password.
<p>The Tracking directive must be a non-blank value to enable tracking.  In
addition, if the tracking database is not yet initialized, the Tracking
directive is used to initialize the first order number to be placed in
the tracking database. After that initialization, the value of the next
order number is kept in the database (under the key <EM>mv_next_order</EM>) and
incremented when an order is placed.  The incrementation is alpha-numeric,
so it is important to have leading zeros in any string value -- i.e., an
initial value of <STRONG>Order00009</STRONG> will be incremented to <STRONG>Order00010</STRONG>, while
an initial value of <STRONG>Order9</STRONG> will be incremented to <STRONG>Ordes0</STRONG>. Also, any
non-alphanumeric characters will be stripped -- <STRONG>Order_00000</STRONG> becomes
<STRONG>Order00000</STRONG>.
<p>The tracking is done by entering information in the DBM database <EM>tracking</EM> in
the products directory. Orders are tracked under two keys,
the actual key (started by the Tracking Directive) and a key that prepends the
string ``Backend'' to the actual key. The entry in the actual key is a facsimile
of the emailed order report -- the Backend key is the values selected in the 
BackendOrder directive, combined with the actual ordered item codes and
quantities, separated by NUL characters (ASCII code 0).
<p>To illustrate, take a MiniVend system that has tracking enabled with
these two configuration directives in the minivend.cfg file:
<p>
<XMP>
    Tracking        Order00001
    BackendOrder    name,address,city,state,zip,account,mv_shipmode

</XMP>
<p>When the user places an order for quantity 2 of item number <EM>P-133</EM>,
the tracking database will have two keys/values added:
<p>
<XMP>
 Key               Value
 ----------------  ----------------------------
 Order00001        (The order report, filled in -- see "Order Report File")
 BackendOrder00001 Joe J. User<NUL>123 Any St.<NUL>Main Street<NUL>OH<NUL>
                   12345<NUL>Acct#123<NUL>P-133<NUL>2

</XMP>
<p>If the customer left a credit card number with the SSL account information form
(see <EM>Order Security</EM>), the credit card number and its associated expiration
date will be placed in two additional fields:
<p>
<XMP>
 Key               Value
 ----------------  ----------------------------
 CcOrder00001      (encrypted data)
 ExpOrder00001     (encrypted data)

</XMP>
<p>The scheme allows a history of orders to be kept (the Order00001 key)
and a list of unentered orders (the BackendOrder00001 key, along with
the CcOrder00001 and ExpOrder00001 keys).  An external program can read
the tracking database and submit the orders to an order-entry system,
removing (or undefining) the BackendOrder, CcOrder, and ExpOrder keys
when finished. An rudimentary example script which displays the tracking
database is supplied as 'trackrpt' in the bin/ directory. This script
could be easily modified to actually perform batch order entry.
<p>Page popularity is simply tracked by storing a count of accesses, with
the page name as the key.  No additional information is stored. It is
designed to give the catalog designer an idea of which features, pages,
and menus are popular, and which are rarely used.  Since individual page
accesses are tracked, it might also give marketing or sales an idea of
problems with product perception -- if an item were frequently looked
at, but rarely bought, it might be appropriate to re-write the catalog
page.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_easy_0">
Easy ASCII Tracking</A>
</H2>
Instead of the DBM-based tracking, you can choose to track only orders

 and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_asciitrack_0"><EM>AsciiTrack</EM></A>
 directives.
<p>If you set AsciiTrack to a legal file name (based in VendRoot unless
it has a leading ``/''), a copy of the order will be saved there as well
as being emailed.
<p>If you set AsciiBackend to a legal file name (based in VendRoot unless
it has a leading ``/''), it will save the backend fields along with
the item-code and quantity of items being ordered.
<p>For either directive, if the file name string begins with a pipe ``|'', 
a program will be run and the output ``piped'' to that program. This
allows easy backend entry of orders with an external program.

<A NAME="minivend_ssl_0">
SSL SECURITY</A>
</H1>
MiniVend has several features that enable secure ordering via SSL
(Secure Sockets Layer). Despite their mystique, SSL servers are actually
quite easy to operate.  The difference between the standard HTTP server
and the SSL HTTPS server, from the standpoint of the user, is only in
the encryption and the specification of the URL -- https: is used for the
URL protocol specification instead of the usual http: designation.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG>  MiniVend attempts to perform operations securely,
but no guarantees or warranties of any kind are made! Since MiniVend
comes with Perl source, it is possible to modify the program to create
bad security problems. One way to minimize this possibility is to record
digital signatures, using MD5 or PGP, of <EM>minivend.pl</EM>,

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
, and all modules included in minivend.pl (standard ones are
Vend/Server.pm, Vend/Imagemap.pm, Vend/Http.pm, Vend/lock.pm, and
possibly Des). Check them on a regular basis to ensure they have not
been changed.
<p>MiniVend uses the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_secureurl_0"><EM>SecureURL</EM></A>
 directive to set the base URL for secure
transactions, and the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vendurl_0"><EM>VendURL</EM></A>
 directive for normal non-secure transactions.
Secure URLs can be enabled for forms through the [process_target action secure]
element, pages through the [pagetarget page frame__secure] element, and
access to the secure account information form is available through the
[secure_order] element.
<p>MiniVend incorporates additional security for credit card numbers.  Any field
on the order form which has <STRONG>credit_card</STRONG> in its name will not be written
to disk unless it is encrypted.  Either an external encryption program, such
as crypt(1) or des(1), can be used, or for internal encryption, the Perl
<EM>Des</EM> module can be used.  The Des module can be defined at program 
configuration time, or can be inserted in the <EM>minivend.pl</EM> configuration
section as the line:
<p>
<XMP>
  use Des;

</XMP>
<p>The Des module is available at the same sites as <EM>Perl Version 5</EM>. It
also requires a functional <EM>libdes</EM> library, which will be harder to
obtain.
<p>To accept credit_card fields, you need to define several things in

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
. First, the directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_creditcards_0"><EM>CreditCards</EM></A>
 needs
to be set to <EM>yes</EM>. Also, 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_tracking_1"><EM>Tracking</EM></A>
 needs to be enabled, to provide a
place to store the credit card numbers as well as a place to store your
access password. 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_encryptprogram_0"><EM>EncryptProgram</EM></A>
 also needs to be defined with at
least some value.  If using the internal <EM>Des</EM> support, the entries
should look something like:
<p>
<XMP>
  CreditCards      Yes
  Tracking         Order00001
  EncryptProgram   internal

</XMP>
<p>If you wish to use an external encryption program, recognize
that this is not nearly as secure as using the internal <EM>Des</EM> option,
for the design of most encryption programs prevents secure transmission
of the password.  The password has to be sent on the command line, and
though MiniVend tries to hide it, not all operating systems will prevent
access to the password through the ps(1) command. If you decide this is
acceptable, here is an example EncryptProgram definition that will work
for many des(1) implementations:
<p>
<XMP>
  EncryptProgram   /usr/bin/des -e -k %p < %f

</XMP>
<p>The <CODE><STRONG>%p</STRONG></CODE> parameter indicates the location where the password will be placed
in the command line, and <CODE><STRONG>%f</STRONG></CODE> is the placeholder for the input file name.
Consult your des(1) manual page for details on how the command line should be
constructed.
<p>If your encryption program allows the password to be placed on the first
line of the text to be encrypted, omit the <STRONG>%p</STRONG> specification.  MiniVend will
send the password, followed by a newline, before sending the text to be
encrypted.  This is much more secure than a command line password, but your
encryption program may not allow this mode of operation.
<p>If the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_creditcards_0"><EM>CreditCards</EM></A>
, 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_encryptprogram_0"><EM>EncryptProgram</EM></A>
 and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_tracking_1"><EM>Tracking</EM></A>
 directives are
defined at program startup, MiniVend will prompt for a password before
starting the server.  This password is checked against a password
previously stored in the tracking database (if it exists), otherwise
MiniVend prompts for a second entry to verify a new password, which is
then stored in the tracking database.  Three tries can be made before
MiniVend gives up.
<p>If encryption is not enabled, MiniVend will silently overwrite any fields
in the order form(s) with X characters.  This prevents non-authorized startups
from saving any sensitive information to disk.

<A NAME="minivend_starting_0">
Starting, Stopping, and Re-starting the Servers</A>
</H2>
When running in server mode, MiniVend operates much faster. Since
it is loaded once, and keeps some of the database files open continuously,
it merely needs to field the CGI request (via vlink) and perform
the appropriate function.  But because it is running, some of the 
databases are locked -- and you will need to unlock them to perform
administrative functions. The supplied scripts will do that
for you.
<p>The following commands assume that you made /usr/local/lib/minivend
your MiniVend base directory.
<p>To start the server:
<p>
<XMP>
    /usr/local/lib/minivend/bin/start [n]

</XMP>
<p>If the optional <EM>n</EM>, an integer from 1 to 9, is supplied, that number
of servers will be started (assuming you have the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_multiserver_0"><EM>MultiServer</EM></A>
 directive
set to <EM>yes</EM>.
<p>Assuming the server starts correctly, you will see a message stating
the process ID it is running under -- that information is also sent
to /usr/local/lib/minivend/error.log.
<p>To re-start the server:
<p>
<XMP>
    /usr/local/lib/minivend/bin/restart [n]

</XMP>
<p>This is typically done to force MiniVend to re-read its configuration.
You will see a message stating that a TERM signal has been sent to the
process ID the servers are running under -- that information is also
sent to /usr/local/lib/minivend/error.log.  Check the error.log file for
confirmation that the server has restarted properly.
<p>To stop the server(s):
<p>
<XMP>
    /usr/local/lib/minivend/bin/stop

</XMP>
<p>You will see a message stating that a TERM signal has been sent to
the process ID the server is running under -- that information is also sent
to /usr/local/lib/minivend/error.log.  
<p>Because processes waiting for lock in MultiServer mode are blocking signals,
they may have to be killed more than once to die.  This is normal and

You can build a complete static page tree for a particular

</XMP>
<p>You must specify a valid catalog to build. If you wish the page tree
to go to a specific directory, you specify it as the next and
optional parameter.
<p>The page build iterates through every page in the pages directory, and
every part number in the database (using the on-the-fly page build), and
builds a page in regular HTML.  All regular page references are converted
to HREFs, except for search, scan, and order references which are kept
relative to VendURL.  This allows you to build static page trees that,
in combination with cookies, can serve many pages via HTTP without parsing
from MiniVend.  It can also build page trees that are scannable by a search
engine spider.

Using Frames</A>
</H2>
MiniVend fully supports frames, the proposed extension to HTML 3.0. (Currently
only Netscape 2.0 and above browsers support frames.) Frames significantly
enhance the electronic catalog experience, since the user can maintain
a context -- with a search frame, a product details frame, a table-of-contents
frame, etc. The demo included with MiniVend is based on frames, though if
you access it with a non-frame browser it will operate perfectly well.
<p>Frames are accessed by adding a TARGET element to a HREF, naming
the frame that the referenced URL should be placed in. MiniVend
produces targets with the pagetarget and areatarget elements, which
send target tags if frames are enabled (by a [frames_on] element.
Any frame name can be used, including the special frames of _top, _blank,
_parent, and _self.
<p>As shown in the demo pages, the best way to accommodate both types of
browsers is by having an <EM>index.html</EM> page that sets the beginning
frame set.  The &lt;FRAMESET&gt; and &lt;FRAME&gt; tags will be ignored by standard
browsers, which will read the HTML between the &lt;NOFRAMES&gt; and &lt;/NOFRAMES&gt;
tags below.
<p>The format of the first set of URLs passed to the frames is important - only
ONE MiniVend link must be called.  That sets the session ID for the user. If
two URLs were called, MiniVend would assign two session IDs to the user,
scrambling the context of their navigation.  From this single access,
all further references to MiniVend are made, though after the first access
multiple frame targets can be referenced.
<p>This first MiniVend page that is accessed (with a frame browser) should
contain a [frames_on] element.  It is the only page that need (or should)
contain a [frames_on], which is persistent throughout the session. This
page should never be seen by a non-frame browser.
<p>Subsequent accesses to MiniVend URLs will now contain the proper session
information, and as long as pagetarget or page elements are used to
pass the URLs, context will be maintained.
<p>The [pagetarget page frame] element is used to pass target tags in hyperlinks.
The [areatarget page frame] element is used to pass target tags in imagemaps.
The [frames_on] and [frames_off] elements enable and disable frame operation.
The [framebase frame] element sets a base target for a page.
<p>See the sample demo pages:
<p>
<XMP>
    greet.html      Starting frame for frames-based browsers - has [frames_on]
    nf_greet.html   Turns off frames -- has [frames_off]
    reframe.html    Re-enables frames after they have been turned off

<A NAME="minivend_body_1">
Body and Buttonbar Control</A>
</H2>
MiniVend provides centralized page color and imagemap control through
use of the [body n] and [buttonbar n] elements. It also can place a random
message from a series of messages with the [random] element, and embed
help messages with the [help item] element.
<p>The [body n] element selects a color scheme -- numbered from 1 to 15 --
that is set by the Mv_Background, Mv_TextColor, Mv_BgColor,
Mv_LinkColor, and Mv_VlinkColor directives. Each can contain up to 15
parameters, after an opening BEGIN. Here is an example:
<p>
<XMP>
    Mv_Background  BEGIN /images/blue_pap.gif
    Mv_BgColor     BEGIN none steelblue white
    Mv_LinkColor   BEGIN none white black
    Mv_TextColor   BEGIN none ltgreen blue
    Mv_VlinkColor  BEGIN none orange purple

</XMP>
<p>The above sequence set in the catalog.cfg file, defines three color
schemes, accessed with [body 1], [body 2], and [body 3] elements in
MiniVend pages.  The first scheme uses the file <EM>/images/blue_pap.gif</EM>
as the background pattern, and keeps the user's default colors for
everything else.  It is called by a [body 1] element, which when
expanded becomes &lt;BODY BACKGROUND="/images/blue_pap.gif&gt;.
<p>The second scheme defines no background pattern (there is only one file
in the Mv_Background directive), but defines a background color of 'steelblue',
with a text color of white, a link color of light green, and a visited link
color of orange. It is accessed by the [body 2] element, which when expanded
becomes &lt;BODY BGCOLOR=``steelblue'' TEXT=``white'' LINK=``ltgreen'' VLINK=``orange''&gt;.
<p>The third color scheme is similar to the second, except defines
white-black-blue-purple for the four colors.  It is accessed with
a [body 3] element.
<p>If there is no defined scheme for a body element (as there wouldn't be if
you put [body 4] in a page with the above schemes defined) MiniVend
simply outputs a standard &lt;BODY> tag.
<p>The user can also define their own colors if the Mv_customcolors
variable is set (upon a form submission).  See the supplied
<EM>control.html</EM> page for an example of how to set custom colors.
<p>Image maps can be supplied and similarly controlled with the [buttonbar n]
series of tags.  They are defined with the ButtonBars directive 
in catalog.cfg, and take the form of a series of
file names in MiniVend format -- i.e., relative to the PageDir and
without a .html extension. To use the buttonbars, create a file 
with an IMG directive set with the USEMAP element and an associated
client-side image map (defined with &lt;MAP&gt; &lt;/MAP&gt;. The [areatarget]
or [area] tags are used to set the URLs. An example:
<p>
<XMP>
    <IMG SRC="/sample/images/artbar0.gif" USEMAP="#ARTBAR0">
    <MAP NAME=ARTBAR0>
    <AREA COORDS="198,0,278,20" HREF="[areatarget fr_sel search]">
    <AREA COORDS="303,0,363,20" HREF="[areatarget fr_search search]">
    <AREA COORDS="388,0,442,20" HREF="[areatarget fr_greet main]">
    <AREA COORDS="473,0,537,20" HREF="[areatarget control main]">
    <AREA COORDS="0,0,560,20" NOHREF>
    </MAP>

</XMP>
<p>If the above were saved in the file PageDir/bars/artbar0.html (where PageDir
is your MiniVend pages directory), you would be able to access this
imagemap in your pages with a [buttonbar 0] tag, at least after MiniVend
read this line in the configuration file:
<p>
<XMP>
    ButtonBars  bars/artbar0 bars/artbar1 bars/artbar2

</XMP>
<p>The above entry allows you to define three imagemaps and access them in
your pages simply as [buttonbar 0], [buttonbar 1], and [buttonbar 2]. The
advantage of this scheme is central definition of a series of button bars
with only a few tags -- if you change your page colors or mapping, you
need only change one file and the change will roll over to all of your
catalog pages. Since some installations can number in the thousands
of catalog pages, using the pre-defined buttonbars can save a lot of
editing. (Server-side includes cannot be used to achieve the same thing
with MiniVend, since they wouldn't have the proper URLs.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_integrated_0">
Integrated Image Maps</A>
</H2>
Imagemaps can also be defined on forms, with the special form variable
<EM>mv_todo.map</EM>.  A series of map actions can be defined --
the action specified in the <EM>default</EM> entry will be applied if none
of the other coordinates match. The image is specified with a standard
HTML 2.0 form field of type <EM>IMAGE</EM>.  Here is an example:
<p>
<XMP>
 <INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="rect submit 0,0 100,20">
 <INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="rect cancel 290,2 342,18">
 <INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="default refresh">
 <INPUT TYPE="IMAGE" NAME="mv_todo" SRC="url_of_image">

</XMP>
<p>All of the actions will be combined together into one image map with
NCSA-style functionality -- see the NCSA imagemap documentation for
details -- except that MiniVend form actions are defined instead
of URLs.  The standard actions are:
<p>
<XMP>
 submit   Submit order
 refresh  Refresh order page (update quantities, etc.)
 cancel   Cancel order and wipe credit card numbers
 return   Go to previous page (or page defined in mv_nextpage variable)
 control  Control help, colors, etc.

Random Banners</A>
</H2>
The [random] element, in conjunction with the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_random_1">Random</A>

</H2>
The [rotate] element, in conjunction with the

legal HTML construct.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_in_line_0">

</H2>
The [help tag] element, in conjunction with the Help directive in the

help messages or images, and is keyed by item name.  The help can be
contained in any of a series of files defined in the Help directive. It
can contain most MiniVend elements.  The user can turn off help through
a form -- see the <EM>control.html</EM> file for an example.

MANUAL INSTALLATION</A>
</H1>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The manual installation procedure is not up to date.
It is HIGHLY RECOMMENDED that you use the configure script.
<p>The MiniVend installation is complex, and requires quite a few distinct
steps.  That is why there is an interactive configuration script that
is included with MiniVend -- it merely does automatically
what is described below. It makes the process much easier, and will
install the demo catalog. This configuration script has been tested
on some, but not all, UNIX systems.  Please report problems
to &lt;<A HREF="MAILTO:mikeh@iac.net">mikeh@iac.net</A>&gt;.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_needed_0">
Needed Directories</A>
</H2>
The MiniVend program, and its supporting libraries, should all
go into one directory.
<p>User catalog pages, user databases, and user configuration files should
all go into their private directories. Because the catalog pages are
served through the MiniVend cgi-bin program and contain nonstandard
elements, they should not be put into a public WWW directory, nor do
they need to have world-readable file permissions.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE</STRONG>: As of MiniVend 2.0, since catalogs are all run
under one server, permissions are complex and very important.
Please let the MiniVend configuration program do the work!
<p>You will want a public WWW directory for in-line image graphic files.
MiniVend does not serve the images, only the HTML tags calling them. A
useful convention is to place all buttonbars, backgrounds, and icons in
the /images directory, with the catalog items perhaps located in the
/images/catalog directory.  It is up to you, but remember that you must
use an <EM>absolute path</EM> -- relative paths will not do. MiniVend 2.0
supports the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_imagedir_0">ImageDir</A>
 directive, which places that as the
absolute path in front of all relative IMG and INPUT SRC specifications.
<p>You will need a cgi-bin directory in which to put the vlink or svend program.

The Demo Systems</A>
</H2>
The products directory contains a sample product file and the file
report in the main directory is the sample order report.  Sample catalog
pages are in the directories sample/ and simple/. If you would like to
use them as a starting point for your own catalog, you can either have
the configure script install the demo for you, or you can copy the
sample files into the MiniVend directory and your HTML directory, which
for these examples is assumed to be /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs.
<p>To install the full-featured demo:
<p>
<XMP>
 cd /usr/minivend                   # wherever your vend directory is
 mkdir /usr/local/etc/httpd/htdocs/sample  # or your document root
