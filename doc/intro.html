Andrew Wilcox wrote <I>Vend,</I> the copylefted shopping cart
software. MiniVend was originally based on Vend V0.2, but has been
greatly enhanced, adding powerful relational database functions, support
for frames, powerful searching, remote administration, super<I>fast</I>
server mode, conditional HTML, user-customizable help and displays, and
much more.  This version of MiniVend includes an automatic configuration
and installation utility, and continues to be free under the GNU copyleft.
