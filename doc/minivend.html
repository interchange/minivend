This document describes MiniVend 3.00, based on Andrew Wilcox's
original Vend, Version 0.2, with portions from Vend 0.3.

DESCRIPTION</A>
</H1>
MiniVend allows customers to select items to buy from catalog pages. The
program tracks which products they have selected and the quantity
desired. From the ordering page they may complete the ordering process
by entering their name and address, or return to browsing and select
more items.  Once the order process is completed, MiniVend submits
the order to the system via email or an external order entry program.
<p>MiniVend plugs into a system with an SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) server,
allowing encrypted transmission of sensitive customer data.  This
capability makes the entry of credit card numbers practical and secure.
<p>Many different catalogs can be run from the same MiniVend server,
allowing an ISP to serve many different customers from one or just
a few MiniVend server processes.
<p>Multiple servers can be forked to serve the same set of catalogs.
This ensures fast response, while only one server runs when there is no
catalog activity.
<p>MiniVend is powerful, and correspondingly complex. It can easily handle
catalogs of a million items or more, with excellent performance. It has
completely flexible page display, search, and order entry capability. If
you only have a few items to catalog, MiniVend is probably overkill for
your needs.  But if you are willing to spend some upfront learning time,
it can support your simple catalog with unlimited room to grow. To get a
fast start with a simple catalog, start with the simple demo and customize
from there.

OVERVIEW OF MINIVEND</A>
</H1>
If you want to get started, just jump to

The following sections briefly describe how MiniVend works.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_how_0">
How MiniVend Manages Sessions</A>
</H2>
Normally, each request for a World Wide Web page which comes in to a
server stands on its own. While the server will probably know which
machine a request comes from, it may not know if the next request
comes from the same browser or even from the same user on that
machine.
<p>MiniVend keeps track of who is ordering what by including in the URL a
session id: a random string which is different for each customer
browsing the catalog.
<p>This session ID is either tracked with cookies, or it can be passed
along through special URLs within catalog pages.  Pages in the catalog
served by MiniVend running as a cgi-bin program generate a special URL
for every link. Here is an example of such a URL:
<p>
<XMP>
    http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1

Catalog pages are written in regular HTML with extensions to.support catalog ordering. Pages are delivered through the following
steps:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>The HTTPD server receives a request for a catalog page.
<p>
<LI>The server is already running as a daemon, and the request calls a small
C program (source is vlink.c) that is named according to which catalog
being called. This program communicates with the MiniVend program via
a UNIX- or INET-domain socket.
<p>
<LI>MiniVend reads the HTML source page from the catalog pages directory,
and interprets the catalog ordering extensions in the file. If the 
page doesn't exist, and corresponds to a part number in the database,
it is built ``on the fly'' using a template page (default is flypage.html).
<p>
<LI>The page, which is now entirely in regular HTML, is delivered to
the HTTPD server, which returns it to the browser.
<p>
</UL>
Once the customer has finished, the completed order is emailed to the.vendor, or placed with an external order entry program (not supplied).

You will need Perl version 5.003 or higher to run MiniVend 3.00. Many
sites are still running lower Perl versions. In addition, on systems
that do not have GDBM or DB_File installed, memory problems may occur.
Large catalogs will use large amounts of memory if the databases must
all reside there.
<p>MiniVend is complex and requires a lot of memory.  See the file LOW_MEMORY
for ways to reduce memory consumption by up to 30<STRONG>% </STRONG>at some penalty in
page loading speed.

<A NAME="minivend_setup_0">
Setup for HTTP Servers</A>
</H2>
The most important issue with MiniVend is the permissions with
which the CGI program and the MiniVend server run.
<p>MiniVend uses a server running <EM>in the background</EM>, with a small
C program (generically called 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
) that communicates with MiniVend via
a UNIX-domain socket.
<p>To improve security, MiniVend normally runs with the socket file
having 0600 permissions (rw-------), which mandates that the CGI
program and the server run <EM>as the same user ID</EM>. This means
that the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
 program must be SUID to the same user ID as
the server executes under.  (Or that CGIWRAP is used on a single
catalog system).
<p>With MiniVend 3.0 multiple catalog capability, the permissions
situation gets a bit tricky.  MiniVend comes with a program,
<EM>makecat</EM>, which configures catalogs for a multiple catalog
system. It should properly set up ownership and permissions
if run as the superuser.
<p><p><hr>

<H1> 
<A NAME="minivend_quick_0">
QUICK START</A>
</H1>
Before you begin, select the base directory where you want to install
MiniVend.  You can unpack the tar file either there, or in another
temporary directory -- the configure script handles either. The
suggested directory is /usr/local/lib/minivend -- but really any
directory will do.  You must of course have write permission there; and
you will eventually need to have write permission on your CGI-BIN
and HTML directories.
<p>If you plan on building multiple catalogs, you will probably want
separate directories to hold the catalog pages and databases. The 
<EM>makecat</EM> program supplied with MiniVend will make those for you.
<p>Decompress and untar the distribution:
<p>
<XMP>
    gzip -d mvend300.tar.gz
    tar xf mvend300.tar

</XMP>
<p>If you have GNU tar, you can combine these steps:
<p>
<XMP>
    tar xzf mvend300.tar.gz

</XMP>
<p>Before installing, check the site where you obtained MiniVend for any
patches that might have been issued since the release.
<p>Run the configure script with:
<p>
<XMP>
    ./configure

</XMP>
<p>If you have trouble with ./configure, try this:
<p>
<XMP>
    /usr/bin/perl configure.pl /usr/bin/perl

</XMP>
<p>Replace the '/usr/bin/perl' with the proper path to
your Perl 5 binary.
<p>The process should be self-explanatory. If you discover any problems,
refer to the section 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_if_0">If something goes wrong</A>
. Otherwise,
MiniVend should be installed at the completion of the script.  It is
strongly suggested that you install the demo catalogs as a starting point for
your own catalog -- the configuration script will give you the
opportunity to do so.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> One point that is to be emphasized --
<EM>only your base html pages go in the document space of your http server.</EM>
Any pages with MiniVend elements/tags go in the directory set by the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pagedir_0">PageDir</A>
 directive (the default is VendRoot/pages). For the demos
supplied with MiniVend, this means that only a few pages will be copied
to your HTML directory, with the remainder of the pages
staying in the directory defined as 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pagedir_0">PageDir</A>
.
<p>If you are on an ISP where <EM>all</EM> of your files are in HTML document
space, you should disable all access to your MiniVend catalog directory
with the proper HTTP access restrictions.  Normally that is creating
a .htaccess file like this:
<p>
<XMP>
  <Limit GET POST>
  order allow,deny
  deny from all
  </Limit>

</XMP>
<p>If you are unable to do this, it is recommended that you do not run
MiniVend. If you can set file permissions such that files will not be
served, it may be OK, but security will be a problem.  Please be careful
with your users' personal information.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_setting_0">
Setting up multiple catalogs</A>
</H2>
MiniVend has multiple catalog capability.  It breaks the configuration
files into two pieces:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_minivend_cfg_0">
minivend.cfg</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This file is located in the main MiniVend directory, and
has only a few server-wide configuration parameters. The most
important is the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_2">Catalog</A>
 directive, which sets up the
catalog configuration.  The sample 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
 supplied
with the distribution defines two catalogs:
<p>
<XMP>
 Catalog sample /home/catalogs/sample /cgi-bin/sample
 Catalog simple /home/catalogs/simple /cgi-bin/simple

</XMP>
<p>Additional parameters set up multi-server capability and
other global system settings.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_catalog_cfg_0">
catalog.cfg</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Located in the directory where the individual catalog resides,
this file has most of the parameters which define the catalog.
See 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_3">Catalog Configuration File</A>
.
<p>
</DL>
Each catalog can be completely independent, with different databases --.or catalogs can share any or all databases and session files.  This
means that several catalogs can share the same information, allowing
``virtual malls''.  Each catalog maintains its own pages and possibly its
own databases, but can easily share ordering information with other
storefronts.
<p>The steps to set up the multiple server capability are:
<p>
<OL>
<LI>Install the MiniVend software. Use the supplied <EM>makecat</EM> program
to install the demo catalogs, 'sample' and 'simple'.  
<p>
<LI>Select one of the options presented at the beginning. When you initially
select that option (ISP/dedicated, virtual host, or standard user) it
will create a configuration file that will retain the answers to the
first set of questions.  In ISP mode, it is especially important to have
the MiniVendUser and MiniVendGroup directives correct if you will have
multiple users configuring and running catalogs.
<p>
<LI>Select a name for your new catalog. The name will be the default name
for the HTML directory to be used, the vlink executable, but it can be
changed at configuration time.  For this example, our name is 'real'.
<p>
<LI>Run the makecat program:
         
            bin/makecat real
<p>
<LI>Answer the prompts, which should have much of the right information by
default (after you have run the program once to set them).  Reply yes when
the makecat program asks if you wish to place the catalog in minivend.cfg.
<p>
</OL>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_if_0">
If something goes wrong</A>
</H2>
First, check the two error log files -- <EM>error.log</EM> in the MiniVend
home directory (where minivend.cfg resides) and <EM>error.log</EM> in the 
catalog directory (where catalog.cfg resides, there can be many of
these).  Many problems can be diagnosed quickly if these error logs
are consulted.
<p>Second, check the README file, the FAQ and bug list at the official
MiniVend web site for information:
<p>
<XMP>
 http://www.minivend.com/minivend

</XMP>
<p>Third, double check that you have the following things:
<p>1. The 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
 program is SUID, or you have made appropriate
changes in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_readpermission_0">ReadPermission</A>
 and <EM>WritePermission</EM> directives.
Unless the files are world-writable, the vlink program and
the MiniVend server must run as the same user ID!
<p>If you are using the <EM>tlink</EM> INET mode link program,
you must have the proper host name(s) configured into the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_tcphost_0">TcpHost</A>
 directive in 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
.  The program selects
port 7786 by default (the ASCII codes for ``M'' and ``V'') -- if you
decide to use another port, you must set the same number in
both the tlink program (before compilation, or by editing
tlink.pl) and the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
 file.
<p>2. That you have proper file permissions.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> The MiniVend server should not run as the user
<EM>nobody</EM>!
<p>The program files can be owned by anyone, but any databases, error logs,
and the directory that holds them must be writable by the proper user ID.
The best way to operate in multi-user, multi-catalog setups is to create
a special <EM>minivend</EM> user, then put that user in the group that each catalog
user is in.  If you can define a group for each individual user, that provides
the best security.  Then all associated files can be in 664 or 775 mode, and
you should have no problems with permissions.
<p>3. The vlink CGI program is SUID, and is owned by the same user
name as the MiniVend server runs as.  You can set the file SUID
with this command:
<p>
<XMP>
    chmod u+s <file>

</XMP>
<p>The <EM>tlink</EM> program does not need to be SUID.
<p>4. The 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
 program is being executed on a machine that has the
socket file <EM>etc/socket</EM> on a directly attached disk. UNIX-domain
sockets will not work on NFS-mounted filesystems!  That means the
server <EM>minivend.pl</EM> and the CGI program 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
 must be executing
on the same machine.
<p>The <EM>tlink</EM> program does not have this problem, but it must have the
proper host name(s) and TCP ports set in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_tcphost_0">TcpHost</A>
 and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_tcpport_0">TcpPort</A>

directives in 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
.  Also, you should be careful of security
if sensitive information like customer credit card numbers is being
placed on a network wire.
<p>5. If you are using 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vlink_0">vlink</A>
, the server is started with the
<EM>start_unix</EM> command -- with <EM>tlink</EM>, the server is started with
<EM>start_inet</EM>.
<p>If you have a problem you are not able to correct, and you have <STRONG>closely</STRONG>
examined the documentation and support resources from front to end,
you can submit a problem report to:
<p>
<XMP>
    http://www.minivend.com/minivend/bugreport.html

</XMP>
<p>MiniVend is an ambitious and complex program, and is not presented as
being <EM>easy to use</EM>, <EM>easy to install</EM>, or <EM>bug-free</EM>.  The
configuration scripts were done to try and make a very painful process
only slightly painful.  Some people install in one pass.  Others never
make it, especially when they are running on an ISP.  Determined and
thoughtful users almost always make MiniVend work.

SETTING UP YOUR CATALOG</A>

MiniVend uses its own tags to implement catalog functions -- they
are similar to normal HTML, but are in [square brackets].  They
will be referred to as either <EM>tags</EM> or <EM>elements</EM> in this document.
<p>In order to set up a custom catalog, there are a number of steps.
<p>You will need to become familiar with the MiniVend tags and
directives to make your own catalog.  The demo catalogs are a good
starting point -- in particular we suggest you pay attention to the
order and search pages.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_start_0">

<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_on_the_fly_0">
On-the-fly pages, static, or both?</A>
</H2>
The on-the-fly page capability of MiniVend makes it easy to build your
catalog without hard-coding a single page. To build category pages,
use the one-click search and a the search result page(s).  To build
single-item pages, use the flypage.html template as an example and
build your own. You can also define a product database field (with the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pageselectfield_0">PageSelectField</A>
 directive) to hold the name of the base on-the-fly
page for that item. You might define it to be the same as the category
of product, for example.
<p>If you have a large catalog, you will almost certainly want to use
the on-the-fly page for most products.  But if you want to mix in a
few extra-special pages, perhaps for your best sellers, you can do so.
Just build the pages and place them in files corresponding to the part
number (in the MiniVend pages directory, of course -- not your HTML
directory).  They will take precedence over the on-the-fly page.
<p>If you have only a small number of products, hard coded pages are just
fine, though you would be surprised how much of a maintenance headache
they are compared to database definitions.  Build them just about like
normal HTML pages, except for the MiniVend tags to order the item.
Place them whereever they can be reached -- if you are using searches,
you will want to name the file by the part number, or at least make a
link to it.

page will contain links to other catalog pages with the [page] element.
Individual products can be ordered by the [order &lt;item-code&gt;] element,
which brings up the shopping basket page ``basket.html''. The shopping
basket page contains information on each item ordered, and optionally
has input boxes for the customer to type in their name and address. If
desired, the customer can be ``stepped through'' the order process (as
is demonstrated in the supplied demos). Once the order has been sent
the receipt page is displayed.  By default this is ``confirmation.html'',
but any page can be defined as the receipt.
<p>Unless you are using the ``cookie'' support, you will normally not want to
include regular hypertext links to pages outside of the catalog. Such
links will not include the session id, which means that if the customer
follows an external link back to the catalog the list of products
ordered so far will have been lost.
<p>Inline images, on the other hand, are served in the normal fashion.
You should include a regular &lt;IMG SRC=``URL''&gt; element, where the URL
refers to a graphic image.
<p>MiniVend has the capability of defining an image directory (with the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_imagedir_0">ImageDir</A>
 directive) that automatically adjusts your image path
to a set base directory.  This is often useful for maintaining
multiple catalogs, since you can use the same relative path for all
images.
<p>As of MiniVend 3.0, there is a powerful static page-building capability
in place.  This allows you to pre-build catalog pages that don't contain
dynamic elements (such as order/shopping basket status) into HTML, then
automatically point the browser to those pages when appropriate.  This
reduces the number of pages that MiniVend must parse in real time, and
can increase server capacity by orders of magnitude.  See

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_static_1">Static Page Building</A>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_cookies_0">
Cookies</A>
</H2>
All you need to do to have users with cookie-capable browsers retain
session context is enable the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_cookies_0">Cookies</A>
 directive.  You can then
intermix standard HREF and MiniVend page links without fear of losing
the shopping basket.  Cookie capability is also required to use search
cacheing, page caching, and statically generated pages.  If the browser
does not support cookies, the cache will be ignored.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_minivend_0">
MiniVend Tags</A>
</H2>
MiniVend has over 80 different elements (we will also interchangeably
refer to them as tags) which are used to access the database, format
and display HTML pages, and perform system control.
A reference to most of the tags follows.
<p><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> In the descriptions, parameters marked with an asterisk* are
optional.
<p>When a tag is separated by an underscore, as in <STRONG>item_list</STRONG>, a dash
is just as appropriate (i.e. <STRONG>item-list</STRONG>). They are interchangeable,
except that the ending tag and beginning tag should match (don't
use [item-list] list [/item_list]).
<p>Beginning with MiniVend 3.0, there is an experimental page
syntax which interprets tags with named arguments, similar to HTML.
It has more regular precedence rules -- tags are interpreted in 
sequential order rather than a set interpolation sequence. (Page serving
speed is usually somewhat slower when using the new syntax.)
The calling syntax is shown under the normal syntax -- if not specified,
it is the same.  Some tags (those inside item_list or loop constructs,
for example) are not changed.
<p>To use the new page syntax, place <STRONG>one</STRONG> [new] tag at the top of the page.
To force old syntax, place <STRONG>one</STRONG> [old] tag at the very top of the page. Further
[new] and [old] tags will control syntax in re-evaluated portions of
the page (for example, within the [tag]minivend tags[/tag] construct).  
<p>See <EM>tags.html</EM> for an alphabetical reference.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_page_0">
[page pg arg*]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(new syntax [page href=``dir/page'' target=``frame'' arg=``argument''])
<p>Insert a hyperlink to the specified catalog page pg. For
example, [page shirts] will expand into &lt;
a <A HREF="href=``http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1''>">href=``http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1''></A>. The
catalog page displayed will come from ``shirts.html'' in the
pages directory.
<p>The additional argument will be passed to MiniVend and placed in
the {arg} session parameter.  This allows programming of a conditional
page display based on where the link came from. The argument is then
available with the tag [data session arg], or the embedded Perl session
variable <STRONG>$Safe</STRONG>{'session'}-&gt;{arg}.
<p>A bit of magic occurs if MiniVend has built a static page for the
target page.  Instead of generating a normal MiniVend-parsed page
reference, a static page reference will be inserted.

<A NAME="minivend_pagetarget_0">
[pagetarget pg frame arg*]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(new syntax [page href=``dir/page'' target=``frame'' arg=``argument''])
<p>Same as the page element above, except it specifies an output frame to
target if frames are turned on.  The name <EM>is</EM> case-sensitive, and if
it doesn't exist a new window will be popped up.  This is the same as
the [page ...] tag if frames are not activated.
For example, [pagetarget shirts main] will expand into a link like &lt;a
<A HREF="href=``http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1''">href=``http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/shirts?WehUkATn;;1''</A> TARGET=``main''&gt;. The
catalog page displayed will come from ``shirts.html'' in the
pages directory, and be output to the 'main' frame.  Be careful,
frame names are case-sensitive.
<p>The optional <EM>arg</EM> is used just as in the <EM>page</EM> tag.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_areatarget_0">
[areatarget pg frame arg*]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(new syntax [area href=``dir/page'' target=``frame'' arg=``argument'']
<p>Inserts a Vend URL in a format to provide a targeted reference for a
client-side imagemap.  You set up the &lt;AREA> tag with:
<p>
<XMP>
      <AREA COORDS="220,0,270,20" HREF="[areatarget page frame]">

<p>If frames are enabled, this will expand to:

(new syntax [area href=``dir/page'' target=``frame'' arg=``argument''])
<p>Like the <EM>areatarget</EM> element, except it will never yield
a frame target.
<p>The optional <EM>arg</EM> is used just as in the <EM>page</EM> tag.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_page_1">
[/page], [/pagetarget]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Expands into &lt;/a&gt;. Used with the page or pagetarget elements, such as:
[page shirts]Our shirt collection[/page] or [pagetarget pants main] Our
pants collection[/pagetarget].  They are syntactically the same, so
you can use either one to terminate an anchor -- the two different ones
are provided for consistency. 
<p>TIP: A small efficiency boost in large pages is to just use the &lt;/A>

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_frames_on_0">
[frames_on]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Turns on the frames processing option, which is disabled by default.
The proper way to use this is to put it ONLY in the first page which
is loaded by frame-based browsers, as part of the initial frame load.
It is persistent for the entire session, or until counteracted with a
[frames_off] tag.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_frames_off_0">
[frames_off]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Turns off the frames processing option.  This can be used to disable
frames, perhaps as a clickable option for users.  It is persistent for
the entire session, or until counteracted with a [frames_on] tag.
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE:  This doesn't turn of frames in your browser! If
you let a TARGET tag escape, it will probably cause a new window
to be opened, or other types of anomalous operation.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_finish_order_0">
[finish_order page*]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(new syntax [finish_order href=``page''])
<p>This element is used to give the customer, while browsing, a way to go
to the shopping basket page to check on their order.  If they haven't
ordered anything yet [finish_order] does not appear at all on the
displayed page. If they have ordered an item, the element will expand
into something like:
<p>
<XMP>
 <a href="http://machine.company.com/cgi-bin/vlink/order;WehUkATn;;1">
 Finish Incomplete Order</a>

</XMP>
<p>If the optional page is supplied, that will be the order page used
to finish the order.
<p>This tag is deprecated -- it is suggested that you use the construct:
<p>
<XMP>
    [if items]
    [page ord/basket]Check Basket[/page]
    [/if]

</XMP>
<p>It will be removed in a future version of MiniVend.

<p>Expands into a hypertext link which will include the specified
code in the list of products to order and display the order page. 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_code_0">code</A>

should be a product code listed in one of the ``products'' databases. The
optional argument <STRONG>cart/page</STRONG> selects the shopping cart the item will be
placed in (begin with / to use the default cart 'main') and the order page
that will display the order. The optional argument <STRONG>database</STRONG> constrains
the order to a particular products file -- if not specified, all databases
defined as products files will be searched in sequence for the item.

<A NAME="minivend_price_0">
[price code quantity* database*]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(new syntax [price code=``code'' quantity=``quantity'' base=``database''])
<p>Expands into the price of the product identified by code as found in
the products database. If there is more than one products file defined,
they will be searched in order unless constrained by the optional
argument <STRONG>base</STRONG>.  The optional argument <STRONG>quantity</STRONG> selects an entry
from the quantity price list.
<p>

<A NAME="minivend_accessories_1">
[accessories code attribute*, type*, field*, database*, name*]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(new syntax [accessories code=``code''
arg="attribute*, type*, field*, database*, name*])
<p>If not given one of the optional arguments, expands into the value
of the accessories database entry for the product
identified by 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_code_0">code</A>
 as found in the products database.
<p>If passed any of the optional arguments, initiates special processing
of item attributes based on entries in the product database.
<p>
<XMP>
   attribute     The item attribute as specified in the UseModifier
                 configuration directive.  Typical are "size" or
                 "color".
   type          The action to be taken. The default is 'select', which
                 builds an HTML select form entry for the attribute.
                                 Also recognized are 'multiple', which builds a multiple
                                 select box, and 'list', which simply lists the possible
                                 values.
   field         The database field name to be used to build the
                 entry (usually a select form field). Defaults to
                 a field named the same as the attribute.
   database      The database to find B<field> in, defaults to the
                 first products file where the item code is found.
   name          Name of the form variable to use if a form is being
                 built.  Defaults to mv_order_B<attribute> -- i.e.
                 if the attribute is B<size>, the form variable will
                 be named B<mv_order_size>.

</XMP>
<p>When called with an attribute, the database is consulted and looks for
a comma-separated list of attribute options.  They take the form:
<p>
<XMP>
    name=Label Text, name=Label Text*

</XMP>
<p>The label text is optional -- if none is given, the <STRONG>name</STRONG> will
be used.
<p>If an asterisk is the last character of the label text, the item is
the default selection.  If no default is specified, the first will be
the default.  An example:
<p>
<XMP>
    [accessories TK112 color]

</XMP>
<p>This will search the product database for a field named ``color''. If
an entry ``beige=Almond, gold=Harvest Gold, White*, green=Avocado'' is found,
a select box like this will be built:
<p>
<XMP>
    <SELECT NAME="mv_order_color">
    <OPTION VALUE="beige">Almond
    <OPTION VALUE="gold">Harvest Gold
    <OPTION SELECTED>White
    <OPTION VALUE="green">Avocado
    </SELECT>

</XMP>
<p>In combination with the <EM>mv_order_item</EM> and <EM>mv_order_quantity</EM> variables
this can be used to allow entry of an attribute at time of order.

<A NAME="minivend_file_0">
[file name]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(new syntax [file name=``name''])

<A NAME="minivend_row_0">
[row nn]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
(new syntax [row width=``nn''])
<p>Formats text in tables.  Intended for use in reports or &lt;PRE&gt;&lt;/PRE&gt; HTML

<A NAME="minivend_minivend_1">
MiniVend Conditional HTML</A>
</H2>
To build complex order forms and reports, MiniVend supplies some conditional
capability with the [if ...] text [else] else-text [/else][/if]
construct.  It allows for testing for a condition within the Vend session,
and if true, inserting text and/or HTML. If the condition is not true, no
text (or the optional [else] text) will be inserted.
<p>This facility cannot be considered a language, for constructs cannot be
nested in a linear fashion, and operations cannot be performed (except
as side effects to the [if] tag).
<p>Starting with MiniVend 3.0, a new tag syntax becomes operational.
It overcomes some of the limitations of MiniVend conditional HTML, but
is still early.
<p><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> MiniVend interpolates tags in a highly ordered fashion, with
each tag having a precedence.  The order of the tag interpolation can
be changed by enclosing the tag in a set of double square brackets, bringing
it forward in the process.  The order of interpolation is:
<p>
<XMP>
  tag [[ANY TAG]] cart item-list loop default value scratch calc if lookup
  set data msql file finish_order frames_on frames_off 
  framebase body help buttonbar random rotate checked selected
  accessories field pagetarget area areatarget page last_page
  perl order nitems discount subtotal shipping shipping_description
  salestax total_cost price currency description row process_order
  process_search process_target

</XMP>
<p>Most of the tests use Perl code, but MiniVend uses the Safe module with
its default restrictions to help ensure that improper code will not
crash the server or modify the wrong data.  There is nothing to be done
if your code enters an endless loop, though, and you have to use this
capability with caution.

config</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The MiniVend configuration variables. These are set
by the directives in your MiniVend configuration file (or
the defaults).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_value_0">
value</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The MiniVend user variables, typically set in search,
control, or order forms. Variables beginning with 'mv_'
are MiniVend special values, and should be tested/used
with caution.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_items_0">
items</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The MiniVend shopping carts. If not specified, the cart
used is the main cart.  Usually used as a litmus test to
see if anything is in the cart, for example:
<p>
<XMP>
  [if items]You have items in your shopping cart.[/if]
  
  [if items layaway]You have items on layaway.[/if]

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_scratch_0">

The MiniVend scratchpad variables, which can be set
with the [set name]value[/set] element. 
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_validcc_0">
validcc</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
A special case, takes the form [if validcc no type exp_date].
Evaluates to true if the supplied credit card number, type
of card, and expiration date pass a validity test.  Does
checksum digit calculation to weed out typos or phony 
card numbers.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_accessory_0">
accessory</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The accessories database.

.
<p>
</DL>
The <EM>field</EM> term is the specifier for that area.  For example, [if session.frames] would return true if the 'frames' session parameter was set.
<p>As an example, consider buttonbars for frame-based setups.  It would be
nice to display a different buttonbar (with no frame targets) for sessions
that are not using frames:
<p>
<XMP>
    [if session frames]
        [buttonbar 1]
    [else]
        [buttonbar 2]
    [/else]
    [/if]

</XMP>
<p>Another example might be the when search matches are displayed. If
you use the string '[value mv_match_count] titles found', it will display
a plural for only one match.  Use:
<p>
<XMP>
    [if value mv_match_count != 1]
        [value mv_match_count] matches found.
    [else]
        Only one match was found.
    [/else]
    [/if]

</XMP>
<p>The <EM>op</EM> term is the compare operation to be used. Compare operations are
as in Perl:
<p>
<XMP>
    ==  numeric equivalence
    eq  string equivalence
    >   numeric greater-than
    gt  string greater-than
    <   numeric less-than
    lt  string less-than
    !=  numeric non-equivalence
    ne  string equivalence

</XMP>
<p>Any simple perl test can be used, including some limited regex matching (no
whitespace or conditionals can be contained in the comparison string). Discussion
of this is beyond the scope of this document.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_then_0">
[then] text [/then]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
This is optional, as the text immediately following the [if ..] tag is
used as the conditionally substitued text. When used, the [then] [/then]
pair allows more readable constructs, as all whitespace around the [then]
and tags will be stripped.  If you wish to have leading or trailing
whitespace, you can enclose the value in single or double quotes.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_else_0">

The optional else-text for an if or if_field conditional.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_condition_0">
[condition] text [/condition]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Only used with the [if explicit] tag. Allows an arbitrary expression
<STRONG>in Perl</STRONG> to be placed inside, with its return value interpreted as

<A NAME="minivend_any_0">
[[any]]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Forces early interpolation of any tag. Sometimes needed if the order
of interpolation does not achieve the desired result (meaning you see
MiniVend tags displayed on the page).
<p><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> This is ignored if using the new syntax.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend__0">
[ n [any] HTML n ]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Where n is a single digit in the range 0-9. If present, it forces early
interpolation of that region of MiniVend tags, and is differentiated from
other early interpolation areas.  The enclosed MiniVendtags will still
be interpolated in the normal order, but it can usually be combined
with the [post] [/post] pair to achieve the desired order.
<p><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> This is ignored if using the new syntax.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_post_0">
[post]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Selects an area that will not be interpolated until after the rest of
the page is interpolated. If followed by a number, will match a terminating

<A NAME="minivend_set_0">
[set variable]value[/set]</A>

<DD>
(new syntax [set name=``variable''] value [/set])
<p>Sets a scratchpad variable to 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_value_0">value</A>
. One way this is used is to
save pages that a customer has seen -- perhaps for a rotating message.
A rotating message implementation is shown in the sample page 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_flypage_0">flypage.html</A>
.
<p>The mv_* variables that are used for search and order conditionals are
in another namespace -- they can be set by means of hidden fields in a
form.

<DT><STRONG>
<EM>[data area field key ``value''* increment*]</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
(new syntax:
    [data base=``database'' name=``field'' code=``key''
        value=``value'' op="increment] )
<p>Returns the value of the field in any of the arbitrary databases,
or from the variable namespaces.  If the optional 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_value_0">value</A>
 is supplied,
the database value will be changed to it -- no ] characters may be
present in the value unless using the new tag style.  If the option
increment* is present, the field will be atomically incremented with
the value in 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_value_0">value</A>
.
<p>If a DBM-based database is to be modified, it must be flagged writable
on the page calling the write tag.  Use [tag flag write]products[/tag]
to mark the <EM>products</EM> database writeable, for example.
<p>Databases will hide variables, so don't name a database ``session'',
``scratch'', or any of the other reserved names! Case is sensitive, so in
a pinch you could call the database ``Session'', but it would be better
not to.

<A NAME="minivend_loop_0">
[loop item item item] value [/loop]</A>

</STRONG>

(new syntax: [loop arg=``item item item''])
<p>Returns a string consisting of the value, repeated for every item in a
comma-separated or space-separated list.  Operates in the same fashion
as the [item-list] tag, except for order-item-specific values. Intended
to pull multiple attributes from an item modifier -- but can be useful
for other things, like building a pre-ordained product list on a page.
<p>Limited to 1024 values in the list in the direct call -- to iterate

one of the enumerated MiniVend export formats. The following tag will
export the products database to products.txt (or whatever you have
defined its source file as), in the format specified by the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_database_0">Database</A>

<p>
<XMP>
        [tag log logs/transactions.txt]
        [item_list][item-code]  [item-description]

Returns a MIME-encapsulated message with the boundary as employed
in the other mime tags, and the

 used as the 
Content-Description. For example
<p>
<XMP>

Builds a one-click search based on the enclosed text. 
Properly translates whitespace and non-word characters to
be parseable by MiniVend. You can add the normal scan options,
just the se=searchtext parameter will be affected. These two
sequences evaluate the same:
<p>
<XMP>
        [tag scan/sf=category]Renaissance[/tag]
        [page scan/sf=category/se=Renaissance]Renaissance[/page]

</XMP>
<p>Where it is useful is in adding long strings that would otherwise
be difficult to encode, like
<p>
<XMP>
        [tag scan/sf=author/os=yes]John F. Kennedy[/tag]

<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_embedded_0">
Embedded Perl Code</A>
</H2>
As of MiniVend 2.0, Perl code can be directly embedded in pages. The tag
is specified as [perl arguments] any_legal_perl_code [/perl].
<p>(new syntax [perl arg=``arguments''])
<p>Using MiniVend variables with embedded Perl capability is not recommended
unless you are thoroughly familiar with Perl 5 references.  It is best to
pass the values you need with MiniVend tags, which are mostly interpolated
before the [perl] tags.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    # Simple example
    my $shipmode = '[value mv_shipmode]';
    # If the item might contain a single quote
    my $comments = '[value comments escaped]';
    # Another method
    my $comments = q{[value comments]};

</XMP>
<p>This allows you to pass user-space variables for most needed
operations.  You can pass whole lists of items with constructs
like:
<p>
<XMP>
    # Perl ignores the trailing comma
    my(%prices) = ( [item_list]
                    '[item_code]', '[item-price]',
                    [/item_list]);

</XMP>
<p>Even easier is the definition of a subroutine:
<p>
<XMP>
    [set Thanks]
    my($name, $number) = @_;
    "Thanks, $name, for your order! The order number is $number.\n";
    [/set]
    [perl sub]
        Thanks ('[value name escaped]', '[value mv_order_number escaped]')
    [/perl]

</XMP>
<p>(The <EM>escaped</EM> causes any single quotes which might be contained in the
values to be escaped, preventing syntax errors in the case of a name like
``O'Reilly''.)
<p>The arguments that can be passed are any to all of:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>

<A NAME="minivend_browser_0">

<A NAME="minivend_carts_0">

<DD>
Gives read-write access to all of the shopping carts.  on order. This

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_cgi_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
Gives read-only access to the actual variables that were passed
in the current CGI session.  This is useful for testing what the

in the session database.  Called with
<p>
<XMP>
  # Set if the user had a value for name in the *current* form
  $name = $Safe{'cgi'}->{name};

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_config_0">
config</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Gives read-write access to the configuration of the catalog. USE WITH
EXTREME CAUTION -- many of the variables are references to anonymous
arrays and hashes.  You can crash your catalog if you modify the wrong
thing. Referred to in your code as <STRONG>$Safe</STRONG>{config}, a reference to the
hash containing the configuration structure.  If you use this, it
is recommended that you refer frequently to the MiniVend source code.

<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_file_1">
file</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
If specified, the anchor text is a file name to read the Perl code from.
This allows code to be maintained in separate files, though you need
to remember that any MiniVend tags contained will generally not be
interpolated (depending on interpolation order and use of the [[any]]
and [post] modifiers).  The file name is relative to the MiniVend base
directory unless specified as an absolute path.

<A NAME="minivend_sub_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
If specified, the anchor text is a subroutine name and optional
parameters to be passed.  The subroutine can be defined in three
ways; as a global subroutine (works for entire server); as a
catalog-wide pre-defined subroutine; or in a scratchpad variable.
All are called with the same syntax -- the arguments are passed
in via the <STRONG>@_</STRONG> argument array.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> Global subroutines are not subject to the stringent
security checking of the <EM>Safe</EM> module, so almost anything goes
there. The subroutine will be able to modify any variable in MiniVend,
and will be able to write to read and write any file that the MiniVend
daemon has permission to write. Though this gives great power, it should
be used with caution. Careful! They are defined in the main minivend.cfg
file, so should be safe from individual users in a multi-catalog system.
<p>Global subroutines are defined in 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
 with the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_globalsub_0">GlobalSub</A>
 directive.
<p>Catalog subroutines are defined in 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_cfg_0">catalog.cfg</A>
, with
the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_sub_1">Sub</A>
 directive.  They are subject to the stringent <EM>Safe.pm</EM>
security restrictions that are controlled by 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_safeuntrap_0">SafeUntrap</A>
.
<p>Scratch subroutines are defined in the pages, and are also subject
to <EM>Safe.pm</EM> checking.  See the beginning of this section for an
example of a subroutine definition. There is no ``sub name { }'' that
surrounds it -- the subroutine is named from the name of the 
scratch variable.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_values_0">
values</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Gives read-write access to the user variables, including the MiniVend
special variables, an anonymous hash.  Referred to in your code as
<STRONG>%{</STRONG>Safe{'values'}} or <STRONG>$Safe</STRONG>{'values'}-&gt;{variable}.
<p>
<XMP>
    # Read the user's selected shipping mode
    my $shipmode = $Safe{values}->{mv_shipmode};

</XMP>
<p>
</DL>
The code can be as complex as desired, but cannot use any operators.that modify the filesystem or use ``unsafe'' operations like ``system'',
``exec'', or backticks.  These constraints are enforced with the default
permissions of the standard Perl module <EM>Safe</EM> -- operations may
be untrapped on a system-wide basis with the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_safeuntrap_0">SafeUntrap</A>
 directive.
<p>The result of the tag will be the result of the last expression
evaluated, just as in a subroutine.  If there is a syntax error
or other problem with the code, there will be no output.
<p>Here is a simple one which does the equivalent of the classic
hello.pl program:
<p>
<XMP>
    [perl] my $tmp = "Hello, world!"; $tmp; [/perl]

</XMP>
<p>Of course you wouldn't need to set the variable -- it is just there
to show the capability.
<p>To echo the user's browser, but within some HTML tags:
<p>
<XMP>
    [perl browser]
    my $html = '<H5>';
    $html .= $Safe{'browser'};
    $html .= '</H5>';
    $html;
    [/perl]

</XMP>
<p>To show the user their name, and the current time:
<p>
<XMP>
    [perl values]
    my $string = "Hi, " . $Safe{values}->{'name'} ". The time is now ";
    $string .= localtime;
    $string;

<A NAME="minivend_on_the_fly_1">
On-the-fly Catalog Pages</A>
</H2>
If an item is displayed on the search list (or order list) and there is
a link to a special page keyed on the item, MiniVend will attempt to
build the page ``on the fly''. It will look for the special page

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_flypage_0">flypage.html</A>
, which is used as a template for building the page.  If

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_item_field_0">[item_field fieldname]</A>
, <EM>[item_price]</EM>, (etc.) elements are used on the page,
quite complex and information-packed pages can be built.  The

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_if_field_0">[if_field fieldname]</A>
 HTML 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_if_field_1">[/if_field]</A>
 pair can be used to insert
HTML only if there is a non-blank value in a particular field.
<p>Because the tags are the same, an [item_list] cannot be used on
an on-the-fly page. The [loop item, item] tag is still usable.

<A NAME="minivend_databases_0">
DATABASES</A>
</H1>
MiniVend, as with most powerful shopping cart programs, is all about
databases.
<p>This version of MiniVend implements the database in GDBM, DB_File, Msql,
or in-memory format. If you have DBM, large catalogs can be used without
using too much memory.  The DBM files are built automatically when they
change, from the the ASCII source file. If you don't have either GDBM
or DB_File, or you set the environment variable MINIVEND_NODBM before
starting the server, an in-memory product database will be used. Catalogs
of more than, say, 1,000 items will use large amounts of memory.
<p>Support for the mSQL database is included. Form-based
updates and inserts allow user input and remote maintenance.
<p>MiniVend reads the data to place in the DBM files from standard
ASCII-delimited files. They can have ^M (carriage return) characters if
desired, but must have a newline character to work -- Mac users
uploading files must use ASCII mode, not binary mode!
<p>Microsoft Excel is a widely-used tool to maintain MiniVend databases,
but has several problems with its standard TAB-delimited export, like
encasing fields containing commas in quotes, generating extra carriage
returns embedded in records, and not including trailing blank fields.
To avoid problems, use a text-qualifier of <STRONG>none</STRONG>, or use the provided
<EM>adjexcel</EM> utility to correct most of those problems.
<p>Three delimiter schemes are provided as standard:
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> The items must be separated by a <STRONG>single</STRONG> delimiter
character. The items are lined up for your reading convenience.

<p>
</DL>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> Using the default TAB delimiter is highly recommended if you.are planning on searching the ASCII source file of the database. PIPE
works fairly well, but CSV delimiter schemes cause problems with searching.
<p>The 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_delimiter_0">Delimiter</A>
 directive sets the scheme, and should be set
to one of those three values.  TAB is the default scheme.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> Field names are always case-sensitive. Unless
you are consistent in the names, you will have problems. All lower
or all upper case names are recommended.
<p>MiniVend uses one mandatory database, the <EM>products file</EM>.  It is
kept in the file 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_products_asc_0">products.asc</A>
 in the products directory by default.
<p>It also has a number of standard but optional databases, some
of which are in fixed special formats:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>

<p>
</DL>
.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_the_0">
The Product Files</A>
</H2>
Each product you are selling should be given a product code: A short
code that identifies the product on the ordering page and in the
catalog. You can use any combination of letters, digits, dashes,
periods, hash signs, or underscores for the product code. The

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_products_asc_0">products.asc</A>
 file is a ASCII-delimited list of all the product codes,
along with an arbitrary number of fields which must contain at least the
fields 'description' and 'price' (or whatever you set the PriceField and
DescriptionField directives to).  Any additional information you want in
the catalog can be placed in any arbitrary field.
See <EM>MiniVend Database Capability</EM>for details on the format.
<p>Field names are case-sensitive. Unless you have fields with the names
``description'' and ``price'' field, you will have to appropriately set the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pricefield_0">PriceField</A>
 and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_descriptionfield_0">DescriptionField</A>
 directives to use the [item-price]
and [item-description] tags.
<p>The product code must be the first field in the line, and must be
unique. Product codes can contain the characters A-Za-z0-9, along with
hyphen (<EM>-</EM>), underscore (<EM>_</EM>), pound sign/hash mark (<EM>#</EM>), slash (<EM>/</EM>),
and period (<EM>.</EM>).
<p>The words should be separated by one of the approved delimiting schemes
(TAB, PIPE, or CSV, set with the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_delimiter_0">Delimiter</A>
 directive), and are
case-sensitive. If you play with the case of the ``description'' or ``price''
field, you will have to appropriately set the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pricefield_0">PriceField</A>
 and

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_descriptionfield_0">DescriptionField</A>
 directives.
<p><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> CSV is not recommended as the scheme for a products
database. It is much slower than TAB- or PIPE-delimited, and dramatically
reduces search engine functionality -- no field-specific searches are
possible.  Don't use it -- you will be sorry if you do. Using CSV for
non-searchable databases is fine, however.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_arbitrary_0">
Arbitrary Databases</A>
</H2>
MiniVend can also manage an unlimited number of arbitrary databases.
They are in the same format as the products file by default, but
an unlimited number of addressable schemes are available. These
are defined by default:
<p>
<XMP>
    Type 1      Default - same as products file (TAB, PIPE, or CSV)
    Type 2      Each field on its own line, a blank line or lines
                separates the record. Watch those carriage
                returns!
    Type 3      Fields separated by a \n%%\n combination, records by
                \n%%%\n (where \n is a newline). Watch those carriage
                returns!
    Type 4      CSV
    Type 5      PIPE
    Type 6      TAB
    Type 7      mSQL
    Type 8      DBI

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_database_0">Database</A>
 directives, as:
<p>
<XMP>
    Database    Arbitrary arbitrary.asc 4

</XMP>
<p>That specifies a type 4 database, the ASCII version of which
is located in the file arbitrary.asc (the DBM file, if any,
will go there as well, as arbitrary.db or arbitrary.gdbm),
and the identifier it will be accessed under in MiniVend is ``Arbitrary''.
<p>The identifier is case sensitive, and can only contain characters
in the class [A-Za-z0-9_]. Fields are accessed with the
[item_data name field] or [data name field key] elements.

<A NAME="minivend_msql_0">
MSQL SUPPORT</A>
</H1>
MiniVend can use mSQL, the Minerva database facility. Minerva is
not included with MiniVend -- it is widely available on the net.
MiniVend uses the fine Msql.pm Perl module by Andreas Koenig, a
very powerful mSQL access method. 
<p>It is beyond the scope of this document to describe SQL, Minerva,
or MsqlPerl, and we will not attempt to.  Familiarity is assumed, 
though the only familiarity with MsqlPerl should be that required
to install the module -- MiniVend should do the rest.
<p>MiniVend cannot create the initial mSQL database, but once the
database is available via the mSQL server (and is writable or readable
by the user ID running the MiniVend server) it can be created from an
ASCII file as with any other MiniVend database.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_importing_0">
Importing from an ASCII file</A>
</H2>
There are a couple of differences in the database definition. MiniVend
by default uses the first column of the ASCII file as the primary key, 
with a <EM>char(14)</EM> type, and assigns all other columns a <EM>char (128)</EM>
definition.  These definitions can be changed by placing the proper
definitions along with the field names on the first line of the file,
for example:
 
  code    description char(250)      price   image
  SH543   Men's fine cotton shirt   14.95   shirts.jpg
<p>This keeps the default MiniVend definitions for code (char 14 and
primary key), price (char 128), and image (also char 128), but sets
the description field to a size and type of <EM>char(250)</EM>.  Any
mSQL type may be used, though if setting the fields with a select
statement you must take care of the formatting.
<p>The field delimiter used for the ASCII file is always TAB, and the
record delimiter is always newline. If 
<p>If you wish to use an existing mSQL database instead of importing, just
make sure there is no file with the same name as the database in the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_productdir_0">ProductDir</A>
 or 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_datadir_0">DataDir</A>
.  If you must have a file for searching, it
is recommended that you use the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_search_file_0">mv_search_file</A>
 variable and make it
another name.  If you do have a file there, just make sure there is a
file in the directory with the same base name and a <EM>.sql</EM> extension,
otherwise an import will be attempted. (In MiniVend 3.0, you may also
set the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_noimport_0">NoImport</A>
 directive.)
<p><STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG> If MiniVend has write permission on the products database,
you <STRONG>must</STRONG> be careful to set the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_noimport_0">NoImport</A>
 directive or create the
proper .sql file. If that is not done, and the database source file
is changed, the Minerva database could be overwritten.  In any case,
always back up your database before enabling it for use by MiniVend.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_dbi_0">
DBI support</A>
</H2>
MiniVend provides an example module for support of SQL databases
via the Perl DBI modules. This is in pre-alpha state, and only the
thick-skinned and courageous should use it.  It will undboubtedly
require hacking on MiniVend to make proper use of it.  It has been
casually tested with DBD::mSQL and DBD::Solid, but many problems
still remain. Eventually it may evolve into full ODBC support.

FORMS AND MINIVEND</A>
</H1>
MiniVend uses HTML forms for order, search, and control operations. 
Order operations possibly include ordering an item, selecting item
size or other attributes, and reading user information for payment
and shipment.  Search operations may also be triggered by a form.
In addition, the user can control certain aspects of the session,
such as order security, frames presentation, and background display
via a control form.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_special_0">
Special Form Fields</A>
</H2>
MiniVend treats some form fields specially, to link to the search engine
and provide more control over user presentation.
It has a number of predefined variables, most of whose names are prefixed with
<EM>mv_</EM> to prevent name clashes. It also uses a few variables which are
postfixed with integer digits -- those are used to provide control in its
iterating lists.
<p>These special fields all begin with <EM>mv_</EM>, and include:
<p>(O = order, S = search, C = control, A = all)

<A NAME="minivend_form_0">
Form Actions</A>
</H2>
Any MiniVend form can be used for any number of actions.  The actions
are mapped by the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_actionmap_0">ActionMap</A>
 directive in the catalog configuration
file, and are selected on the form with either the <EM>mv_todo</EM> or 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_doit_0">mv_doit</A>

variables.
<p>Mapping of actions in the ActionMap directive means that the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_value_0">value</A>
 of 
the submit button is scanned to determine the action.  To map the string
``Place Order'' to the action submit, you would put in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_cfg_0">catalog.cfg</A>
 file:
<p>
<XMP>
    ActionMap    submit place order

</XMP>
<p>And on the form you would make a submit button:
<p>
<XMP>
    <INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="mv_todo" VALUE="Place Order">

</XMP>
<p>When the button is clicked by the user, the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_submit_0">submit</A>
 action will
be performed.
<p>To set a default action for a form, set the variable 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_doit_0">mv_doit</A>
 as
a hidden variable:
<p>
<XMP>
    <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mv_doit" VALUE="refresh">

</XMP>
<p>When any other submit button (for a meaningless variable, the MiniVend
demos use <EM>mv_submit</EM>) is pressed, the <EM>mv_todo</EM> value will not be
found, so the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_refresh_0">refresh</A>
 action defined in 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_doit_0">mv_doit</A>
 will be used.
<p>The defined actions are:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_cancel_0">
cancel</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
All user information (with the exception of the frames and secure
variable settings) is erased, and the shopping cart is emptied. The
user is then mv_nextpage or mv_orderpage.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_checkout_0">
checkout</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The shopping cart and user variables are updated, and the
user is sent to the page defined in the variable 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_checkout_0">mv_checkout</A>
 or
the CheckoutPage directive.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_control_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
The user help, frames, security, and color/background information
is examined and settings changed if appropriate.  The shopping cart

Simply updates the user variables and returns to the page defined
in mv_orderpage.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_return_0">
return</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Updates the user variables and returns to the page defined
in mv_nextpage, or the user's last non-order/non-search page.
This is difficult to use, for it is hard to predict what that
page will be.  Setting mv_nextpage with the value of a scratch
variable works well.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_search_0">
search</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The shopping cart and user variables are updated, then the form
variables are interpreted and the search specification contained
therein is dispatched to the search engine -- results are returned
on the defined search page (set by 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_search_page_0">mv_search_page</A>
 or the search
page directives).
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_submit_0">
submit</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Submit the form for order processing. If no order profile is defined
with the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_order_profile_0">mv_order_profile</A>
 variable, the order will be checked to see
if the current cart contains any items and be checked against the fields
defined in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_requiredfields_0">RequiredFields</A>
 directive.  Assuming those checks pass,
the order will be submitted.
<p>If there is an order profile defined, the form will be checked against
the definition in the order profile and submitted if the pragma &amp;final
is set to <STRONG>yes</STRONG>.  If &amp;final is set to <STRONG>no</STRONG> (the default), and the check
succeeds, the user will be routed to the MiniVend page defined in mv_successpage,
mv_nextpage, or mv_orderpage. Finally, if the check fails, the user will be
routed to mv_failpage, mv_nextpage, or mv_orderpage in that order.

.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_one_click_0">
One-click Multiple Variables</A>
</H2>
MiniVend can set multiple variables with a single button or form
control.  You first define the variable set (or profile, as in
search and order profiles) inside a scratch variable:
<p>
<XMP>
  [set Search by Category]
  mv_search_field=category
  mv_search_file=categories
  mv_todo=search
  [/set]

</XMP>
<p>The special variable <EM>mv_click</EM> sets variables just as if they
were put in on the form. It is controlled by a single button,
as in:
<p>
<XMP>
    <INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="mv_click" VALUE="Search by Category">

</XMP>
<p>When the user clicks the submit button, all three variables will take
on the values defined in the ``Search by Category'' scratch variable. You
can set the scratch variable on the same form as the button is on -- in
fact that is recommended for clarity.
<p>The variable will not be carried from form to form, it must be set
on the form being submitted.
<p>The special variable <EM>mv_check</EM> sets variables for the form actions

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_checkout_0">checkout, control, refresh, return, search,</A>
 and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_submit_0">submit</A>
. 
This setting operates after all of the values are set from the form,
including the ones set by <EM>mv_click</EM>, and can conditionally modify
form variables that have already been set by
<p>The variable sets can contain and be generated by most MiniVend tags --
the profile is interpolated for MiniVend tags before being used. Careful
of interpolation order, and don't use the [post] tag -- it will not work.
Embedded Perl <EM>will</EM> work, and is recommended for most conditional
operations within the profile.
<p>Any setting of variables already containing a value will overwrite
the variable, so to build sets of fields (as in mv_search_field
and mv_return_fields) you must use comma separation or place the
null character with &amp;#0;
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_checks_0">
Checks and Selections</A>
</H2>
You can provide a ``memory'' for drop-down menus, radio buttons, and
checkboxes with the [checked] and [selected] tags.

<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_setting_2">
Setting Form Security</A>
</H2>
You can ensure that a form will be submitted securely (to the base
URL in the SecureURL directive, that is) by specifying your form
input to be ACTION=``[process-target frame secure]''. If you are not
using frames, just specify the special frame ``_self'' or ``none''.
<p>To submit a form to the regular non-secure server, just omit the
<EM>secure</EM> modifier.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_stacking_0">
Stacking Variables on the Form</A>
</H2>
Many MiniVend variables can be ``stacked'', meaning they can have
multiple values for the same variable name. As an example -- to allow
the user to order multiple items with one click, you can set up
a form like this:
<p>
<XMP>
 <FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="[process-order]">
 <input type=checkbox name="mv_order_item" value="M3243"> Item M3243
 <input type=checkbox name="mv_order_item" value="M3244"> Item M3244
 <input type=checkbox name="mv_order_item" value="M3245"> Item M3245
 <input type=hidden name="mv_doit" value="refresh">
 <input type=submit name="mv_junk" value="Order Checked Items">
 </FORM>

</XMP>
<p>The stackable <EM>mv_order_item</EM> variable with be decoded with multiple
values, causing the order of any items that are checked.
<p>To place a ``delete'' checkbox on your shopping basket display:
<p>
<XMP>
 <FORM METHOD=POST ACTION="[process-order]">
 [item-list]
   <input type=checkbox name="[quantity-name]" value="0"> Delete
   Part number: [item-code]
   Quantity: <input type=text name="[quantity-name]" value="[item-quantity]">
   Description: [item-description]
 [/item-list]
 <input type=hidden name="mv_doit" value="refresh">
 <input type=submit name="mv_junk" value="Order Checked Items">
 </FORM>

</XMP>
<p>In this case, <STRONG>first</STRONG> instance of the variable name set by [quantity-name]
will be used as the order quantity, deleting the item from the form.
<p>Of course, not all variables are stackable. Check the documentation for
which ones can be stacked -- or experiment on your own.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_setting_3">
Setting mSQL tables with a form</A>
</H2>
You may insert or update records in any mSQL database with the [msql set]
tag, but if you wish to do form-based updates or inserts you can create
a special form to do so. Four special MiniVend variables are used to
select the database parameters:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_data_table_0">
mv_data_table</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>

<p>
</DL>
A special submit button calling the action <STRONG>set</STRONG> (see 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_actionmap_0">ActionMap</A>
),.causes the update.  Here is an pair of example forms.  One is used
to set the key to access the record (careful with the name, this one
goes into the user session values). The second actually performs the
update. It uses the [loop] tag to place default/existing values in the
form based on the input from the first form:

<H1> 
<A NAME="minivend_the_1">
THE SEARCH ENGINE</A>
</H1>
MiniVend implements a search engine which will search the product
database (or any other file) for items based on customer input.  It uses
either forms or URL-based searches (called with the special page name
<EM>scan</EM>).  The search engine uses many special MiniVend tags and variables.
<p>Examples of search forms and result pages are included in the supplied
demos.
<p>Two search engine interfaces are provided, and four types of searching
are available.  The default is a text-based search of the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_products_asc_0">products.asc</A>
 file.  A binary search of a dictionary-ordered file can
be specified.  An optional Glimpse search is enabled by placing
the command specification for Glimpse in the directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_glimpse_0">Glimpse</A>
.
The last is a range-based search, used in combination with
one of the above.
<p>The default, a text based search, sequentially scans the lines in
the target file.  By default it returns the first field (delineated by
the standard 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_delimiter_0">Delimiter</A>
), for every line matching the search
specification.  This corresponds to the product code, which is then
used to key specific accesses to the database.
<p>The text-based search is capable of sophisticated field-specific
searches with fully-independent case-sensitivity, substring, and negated
matching. (There is not yet a full search language except for SQL queries,
so AND/OR matching is not supported across multiple fields. Stay tuned
for this in MiniVend 3.1 or later.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_the_2">
The Search Form</A>
</H2>
A number of variables can be set on search forms to determine which search
will be used, what fields in the database it will search, and what search
behavior will be.
<p>Here is a simple search form:
<p>
<XMP>
  <FORM ACTION="[process-search]" METHOD=POST>
  <INPUT TYPE="text" SIZE="30" NAME="mv_searchspec">
  <INPUT TYPE="submit" NAME="mv_todo" VALUE="Search">
  </FORM>

</XMP>
<p>When the ``Search'' submit button is pressed (or &lt;ENTER&gt; is pressed)
MiniVend will search the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_products_asc_0">products.asc</A>
 file for the string entered
into the text field 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_searchspec_0">mv_searchspec</A>
, and return the product
code pertaining to that line.
<p>The same search for a fixed string, say ``shirt'', could be performed with
the use of a hot link, using the special <EM>scan</EM> URL:
<p>
<XMP>
  [page scan/se=shirt]See our shirt collection![/page]

</XMP>
<p>The default is to search every field on the line.
If you only wished to match on the string shirt in the product
database field ``description'', you could modify the search:
<p>
<XMP>
  <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mv_search_field" VALUE="description">

</XMP>
<p>In the hot-linked URL search:
<p>
<XMP>
  [page scan/se=shirt/sf=description]See our shirt collection![/page]

</XMP>
<p>If you want to let the user decide on the search parameters, you can
use checkboxes or radiobox fields to set the fields:
<p>
<XMP>
    Search by author
       <INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="mv_search_field" VALUE="author">
    Search by title
        <INPUT TYPE="checkbox" NAME="mv_search_field" VALUE="title">

</XMP>
<p>Fields can be stacked -- if more than one is checked, all checked fields
will be searched. (This doesn't work for Glimpse in the return_file_name
mode, though).

<STRONG>To use the Glimpse search</STRONG>, you must build the Glimpse index based on
files in your 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_productdir_0">ProductDir</A>
, or wherever the files to be searched will
be located. If you installed MiniVend in the default
<EM>/usr/local/lib/minivend</EM>, the command line to build the index for the
products file would be:
<p>
<XMP>
    glimpseindex -b -H /usr/local/lib/minivend/products products.asc

</XMP>
<p>There are several ways to improve search speed for large catalogs.
<p>One method that works well for large 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_products_asc_0">products.asc</A>
 files is to split
the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_products_asc_0">products.asc</A>
 file into small index files (in the example, 100
lines) with the split(1) UNIX command, then index it with glimpse:
<p>
<XMP>
    split -100 products.asc index.asc.
    glimpseindex -H /usr/local/lib/minivend/products index.asc.*

</XMP>
<p>This will dramatically increase search speeds for large catalogs, at
least if the search term is relatively unique. If it is a common string,
as you might have in a category search, you will be better off to use
the text-based search.
<p>(A large catalog is one of more than several thousand items -- smaller
ones have acceptable speed in any of the search modes.)
<p>If the Glimpse executable is not found at MiniVend startup, the Glimpse
search will be disabled and the regular text-based search used instead.
<p>There are several things you have to watch for while using <STRONG>glimpse</STRONG>,
and a liberal dose of the Glimpse documentation is suggested. In particular,
the spelling error capability will not work in combination with the
field-specific search -- Glimpse selects the line, but MiniVend's
text-based search routines disqualify it when checking to see if the
search string is within one of the specified fields.

<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_fast_0">
Fast Binary Search</A>
</H2>
<STRONG>Fast binary searching</STRONG> is useful for scanning large databases for
strings that match the beginning of a line.  They use the standard
Perl module Search::Dict, and are enabled through use of the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_look_0">mv_dict_look</A>
,

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_end_0">mv_dict_end</A>

, and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_order_0">mv_dict_order</A>

variables.
<p>The search must be done on a <STRONG>dictionary-ordered</STRONG> pre-built index, 
production of which is left as an exercise for the user.
<p><STRONG>Hint:</STRONG> the field to search is the first field in the file, then the
product code should be in the second field, delimited by 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_delimiter_0">Delimiter</A>
.
You will also have to set mv_return_fields=1 to return the product code
in the search.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_range_0">
Range Searching</A>
</H2>
Range searching allows you to qualify your search returns with a field
that must be within a certain numeric or alphanumeric range.  To use it,
set the mv_range_look variable to the products database field, or a
column/field number for another file.  Then set the corresponding

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_range_min_0">mv_range_min</A>
 and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_range_max_0">mv_range_max</A>
 variables with a selectable field.
<p>
<XMP>
    <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mv_range_look" VALUE="price">
        Search on Price
    Min <SELECT NAME="mv_range_min">
             <OPTION value=0 SELECTED> Free
             <OPTION value=1000000> $1,000,000
             <OPTION value=10000000> $10,000,000
             <OPTION value=20000000> $20,000,000
             <OPTION value=40000000> $40,000,000
        </SELECT><BR>
    Max <SELECT NAME="mv_range_max">
            <OPTION value=0 SELECTED> no object

            <OPTION value=10000000> $10,000,000
            <OPTION value=20000000> $20,000,000
            <OPTION value=40000000> $40,000,000
        </SELECT>

</XMP>
<p>The value of 0 for mv_range_max is equivalent to infinity if doing a
numeric search. (This makes it impossible to search for a ceiling of 0
with a negative mv_range_min, just in case you were planning on trying
that.)
<p>The fields are stackable, so you can set more than one range to
check.  The order is significant, in the sense that the array
of field names and minimum/maximum values must be kept in order
to achieve correspondence.
<p>The optional 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_range_alpha_0">mv_range_alpha</A>
 specification allows alphanumeric range
matching for the corresponding field -- if it is set, and you have
stacked the fields, they must all be set.  The 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_case_0">mv_case</A>
 field does
apply if it is set -- otherwise the comparison is without regard to
case.
<p>If you wish to do ONLY a range search, you must select all lines
with <EM>mv_return_all</EM>=yes in order to make the search operate. Range-only
searches will be quite slow for large databases, since every line
must be scanned.  It should be quite usable for catalogs of less than
10,000 items in size, given a fast machine.  Using it in combination
with another search technique (in the same query) will yield faster search
returns.

<p>They can be treated just the same as form variables on the
page, except that they can't contain spaces, '/' in a file
name, or quote marks.  These characters can be used, but only
in a scheme like URL decimal encoding, i.e. .32 is a space, .47 is a
<CODE>/</CODE>, etc. -- <CODE>&amp;sp;</CODE> or <CODE>&amp;#32;</CODE> will not be recognized.
<p>So if you wish to do an OR search on the fields category and artist
for the strings ``Surreal'' and ``Gogh'', while matching substrings,
you would do:
<p>
<XMP>
 [page scan/se=Surreal/se=Gogh/os=yes/su=yes/sf=artist/sf=category]
    Van Gogh -- compare to surrealists

<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_search_1">
Search Profiles</A>
</H2>
You can predefine an unlimited number of search profiles that reside
in a file or files.  To use this, make up a series of lines like:
<p>
<XMP>
 mv_searchfield=artist
 mv_searchfield=category
 mv_orsearch=yes

</XMP>
<p>and place them in a file.  Define the file name in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_searchprofile_0">SearchProfile</A>

directive. Re-start the server.  The profiles are numbered in the 
order found (not by file name), starting at 0,  and are available by
setting the variable mv_profile to the number of the profile.
The profile may be named by placing a name following a __NAME__
pragma:
<p>
<XMP>
  __NAME__ title_search

</XMP>
<p>The __NAME__ must begin the line, and be followed by whitespace
and then the name.  The search profile can then be accessed by

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_profile_0">mv_profile=``title_search''</A>
.
<p>The special variable <EM>mv_last</EM> stops interpretation of search
variables.  The following variables are always interpreted:
<p>
<XMP>
    mv_dict_look
    mv_searchspec
    mv_range_look
    mv_range_min
    mv_range_max

</XMP>
<p>Other than that, if you set mv_last in a search profile, and there
are other variables on the search form, they will not be interpreted.
<p>The search profiles are also available, and especially useful, for
one-click searches.  They are available by setting scan/mp=n/se=text,
where n is the number of the profile.
<p>If you want to place multiple search profiles in the same file,
separate them with __END__, which must be on a line by itself.
Be careful, then they are interpreted in the order found, with 
the second file name not necessarily being the second profile (which
would be numbered 1).

the proper variable names for passing to MiniVend.  It is also necessary
that you copy the hidden variables as-is -- they are required to
interpret the request as a search.  The special form variables are:
<p>The following definitions frequently refer to <EM>field name</EM> and <EM>column</EM>

If the file to be searched is left empty in the search form or definition

In the text search, set to the directory from which to base file

<p>If stacked to match the mv_search_field and mv_searchspec variables,

<p>Case sensitivity, substring matching, and negation all work on a field-by

</STRONG>
<DD>
Automatically set the limiting string (mv_dict_end) to be one character
greater than the mv_dict_look variable, at the character position
specified.  A value of 1, for instance, will set the limiting string
to ``fprsythe'' if the value of 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_look_0">mv_dict_look</A>
 is ``forsythe''.  A useful
value is -1, which will increment the last character (setting the 
mv_dict_end to ``forsythf'' in our example).  This prevents having
to scan the whole file once a unique match is found.
<p>The order of this and the

<A NAME="minivend_mv_field_names_0">
mv_field_names</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Defines the field names for the file being searched. This guarantees
that they will be available, and prevents a disk access if using named

where field names are already known).  This <STRONG>must</STRONG> be exactly correct,
or it will result in anomalous search operation.  Usually passed in a
hidden field or search profile as a comma-separated list.
<p>NOTE: You should use this on the product database only if you

<A NAME="minivend_mv_searchspec_0">
mv_searchspec</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The actual search string that is typed in by the customer. It is 
a text INPUT TYPE=TEXT field, or can be put in a select (drop-down)
list to enable category searches. If multiple instances are found,
they will be concatenated just as if multiple words had been 
placed in a text field.
<p>The user can place quotes around words to specify that they match
as a string. To enable this by default, use the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_exact_match_0">mv_exact_match</A>

<p>If 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_dict_look_0">mv_dict_look</A>
 has a value, and mv_searchspec does <STRONG>not</STRONG>, then
mv_searchspec will be set to the value of mv_dict_look.
<p>If the number of instances matches the number of fields specified in the
mv_search_field variable, and mv_coordinate is set to true, each search

<A NAME="minivend_mv_sort_command_0">
mv_sort_command</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Set to a path name that will access the standard UNIX sort command --

<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mv_sort_field_0">
mv_sort_field</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The file field(s) the search is to be sorted on, specified in one of two
ways. If the file(s) to be searched have a header line (the first line)
that contains 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_delimiter_0">Delimiter</A>
-separated field names, it can be specified
by field name.  If can also be specified by column number (the code or key
is specified with a value of 0, for both types).  These can be stacked,
if coming from a form, or placed in a single specification separated
by commas.
<p>NOTE FOR ADVANCED USERS: If specifying a sort for the product database,

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_field_names_0">mv_field_names</A>

The sample search page also has a link to a help file <EM>(pages/help.html)</EM>.which has rudimentary end-user help for the search engine.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_the_3">
The Results Page</A>
</H2>
Once a search has been done, there needs to be a way of presenting
the output.  By default, the special page search.html is used -- but
any number of search pages can be specified by passing the value in
the search form, specified in the variable 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_search_page_0">mv_search_page</A>
.
<p>On the search page, some special MiniVend tags are used to format
the otherwise standard HTML.  Each of the iterative tags is
applied to every code returned from the search -- this is normally
the product code, but could be a key to any of the arbitrary
databases. The value placed by the [item-code] tag is set to whatever
the first field (separated by whitespace) is, at least when the 
default of <STRONG>yes</STRONG> is in the UseCode directive. 
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_search_list_0">
[search_list]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Starts the representation of a search list. MiniVend tags can be
embedded in the search list, yielding a table or formatted
list of items with part number, description, price, and  hyperlinks to
order or go to its catalog page. 
<p>In particular, all of the item tags described under order page
are active.  The most useful one might be [item_link], which if
properly used, can allow the user to search the catalog for
an item, then click a link to go to detailed catalog page
for the item. See the sample results.html page for an example.
<p>In fact, any of the MiniVend database access tags can be used,
allowing you to pull data from any of the fields in any of
your predefined databases.  Along with the MiniVend conditional
tags, very complex pages can be built for each individual item
returned in the search.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_search_list_1">

Ends the search list.  
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_sort_0">
[sort frn]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Placed inside the search list. Causes sorting of the search return,
starting from the first position on the line.  The fields that are there
to sort are set by 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_return_fields_0">mv_return_fields</A>
. Accepts none, any, or combinations
of the flags:
<p>
<XMP>
  f   case-insensitive sort (folded) (mutually exclusive of n)
  n   numeric order (mutually exclusive of f)
  r   reverse sort

</XMP>
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>[sort]&lt;options&gt;[/sort]</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Placed inside the search list. Causes sorting of the search return
based on the passed options. The fields that are there
to sort are set by 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_return_fields_0">mv_return_fields</A>
.
<p>The field options passed in either numeric or field name form.  If
they are field numbers, they are numbered as sent to the search list
in the order specified by 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_return_fields_0">mv_return_fields</A>
,
starting from 0 and proceeding upwards.  If column names, they are
as found in the first record of the searched file (by default the
ASCII source for the product database), <EM>except for the key or first field</EM>.
followed by a 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_required_1">required</A>
 colon (:) and the options, if any.
<p>Accepts none, any, or combinations of the flags:
<p>
<XMP>
  f   case-insensitive sort (folded) (mutually exclusive of n)
  n   numeric order (mutually exclusive of f)
  r   reverse sort

</XMP>
<p>The &lt;options&gt; are a field number and an optional flag or flags, in a
similar fashion to the Unix sort command, and are interpolated for form
values before being used.  As an example, if you set up the following
fields on your search form:
<p>
<XMP>
  <INPUT TYPE="hidden" NAME="mv_return_fields" VALUE="0,title,artist,price">
  <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="the_sort_field" VALUE="title"> Sort by Title
  <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="the_sort_field" VALUE="artist"> Sort by Artist
  <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="the_sort_option" VALUE=""> Forward sort
  <INPUT TYPE="radio" NAME="the_sort_option" VALUE="r"> Reverse sort
  
  NOTE: The 0 refers to the database code/key used for [item-code]

</XMP>
<p>This would combine with the following search result page fragment
to sort by either title or artist.
<p>[search-list]
  [sort]
    [value the_sort_field]:[value the_sort_option]
  [/sort]
<B&gt;[item-field title]&lt;/B&gt;, by [item-field artist]&lt;BR&gt;
[/search-list]
   
The [value...] lines will end up looking like 'artist:r' or 'title:'.  This
could also be specified with <EM>2r</EM> or &lt;1&gt;.
<p>PERFORMANCE TIP: on heavily trafficed systems, it will pay to use only
column numbers rather than named fields, as it reduces processing and may
obviate an access to the searched file to find the field names.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_uniq_0">
[uniq]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Placed <EM>immediately</EM> after the [search_list] tag. If specified on a
sorted return list, causes only the first line containing an [item-code]

list. Note that [matches] and [more-list] may not operate as you
wish in this case.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_matches_0">
[matches]</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Replaced with the range of match numbers displayed by the
search page.  Looks something like ``1-50''. Make sure
you insert this item between a [more_list] and [/more_list]
element pair.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_more_list_0">
[more_list next_img* prev_img* page_img*]</A>

<DD>
Starts the section of the search page which is only displayed
if there are more matches than specified in 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_matchlimit_0">mv_matchlimit</A>
.
If there are less matches than the number in mv_matchlimit, all
text/html between the [more_list] and [/more_list] elements is
stripped.
<p>Use in conjunction with the [more] element to place pointers to
additional pages of matches.
<p>If the optional arguments <EM>next_img</EM>, <EM>prev_img</EM>, and/or <EM>page_img</EM>
are present, they represent image files that will be inserted instead
of the standard 'Next', 'Previous', and page number.  If <EM>prev_img</EM>
is <STRONG>none</STRONG>, then no previous link will be output.  If <EM>page_img</EM> is
<STRONG>none</STRONG>, then no links to pages of matches will be output. These are
URLs, are substituted for with 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_imagedir_0">ImageDir</A>
, and will be encased in
IMG tags.
<p>In addition, if <EM>page_img</EM> is used, it will be passed an argument of
the digit that is to be represented.  This would allow an image generator
program to be used, generating page numbers on the fly.
<p>As an example, if you use [more-list next.gif prev.gif page_num.cgi], the
following will be the anchors:
<p>
<XMP>
  Previous   <IMG BORDER=0 SRC="prev.gif">

<p>The current page will not be a hyperlink.  Every time the new

 (default is ``More Details'').
If the page is not present, then 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_flypage_0">flypage.html</A>
 will be used to build
a page from the entry in the database.  If that doesn't work (perhaps

<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_updating_0">
Updating session variables after a search</A>
</H2>
You may notice that if you set a scratch variable or reference a

not stay in the user session.
<p>To change this, set the

in question:
<p>
<XMP>
        [set mv_put_session]Yes[/set]

</XMP>
<p>This setting is persistent, so it is recommended that you
do it once at the beginning of the user session if you wish it to be the
default.  If you don't want it to be the default, reset it to the

<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_using_0">
Using a Search Cache</A>
</H2>
Each catalog may maintain a search cache, which is enabled by
specifying a file name (the name of the search cache DBM) in
the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_searchcache_0">SearchCache</A>
 directive in 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_cfg_0">catalog.cfg</A>
. It operates by
developing a 32-bit checksum of the combined parameters of a 
one-click scan search, or by combining the variable names/values
specified in <EM>mv_cache_params</EM> on a form-based search.
<p>If your catalog frequently specifies category searches in a
large catalog, speed of search return can be increased by a
large factor.
<p>You needn't do more than just enable the cache for one-click
searches.  To make them operate on a form-based search, specify
the form variable names, separated by a spaces and/or a comma,
that will generate a unique cache key.  Example:
<p>
<XMP>
  <INPUT TYPE=hidden NAME="mv_cache_params"
    VALUE="mv_searchspec,mv_substring_match,mv_search_field">

</XMP>
<p>If you have the MD5 module installed on Perl, it will be used
to generate the cache keys.  This will guarantee a unique
cache ID. 
<p>If you don't have MD5 installed, a 32-bit checksum will be used to create
the cache key.  It is conceivable, but unlikely, that two separate
searches could generate the same 32-bit checksum and return the same
cached search.
<p>IMPORTANT NOTE:  The search cache is only invalidated by a
catalog reconfiguration.  If you change your product database
or any other files you search, you should reconfigure or the
search returns may be wrong.
<p>Search caching is disabled on a client-by-client basis if the
client browser does not have cookie capability, for the generated
session numbers would be incorrect otherwise.

A [loop item,item..] list is similar, but does not include the items.that are associated with the order list, and the tags are prefixed
<EM>loop_</EM>, so that loop and item lists may be interspersed.  Item lists
are evaluated before loop lists, so you can put an item-code inside of
an loop list. If you want to reverse the order, put the loop list in a

may be present in a loop list.

<A NAME="minivend_multiple_0">
Multiple Shopping Carts</A>
</H2>
You can maintain multiple shopping carts with MiniVend (2.02 and above).
One shopping cart -- main, by name -- is defined when the user session
starts.  If the user orders item M1212 with the following tag:
<p>
<XMP>
    [order M1212 layaway] Order this item! [/order]

</XMP>
<p>the order will be placed in the cart named <EM>layaway</EM>. However, by default
you won't see what you want!  That is because the default shopping basket
page won't display the cart you are thinking it will -- it will show
the main cart.  So copy the default cart (pages/ord/basket.html in the demos)
to a new file, insert a [cart layaway] tag, and submit it as a MiniVend
page name addendum to the cart name:
<p>
<XMP>
    [order M1212 layaway/lay_basket] Order this item! [/order]

</XMP>
<p>Now the contents of the <EM>layaway</EM> cart will be displayed.  If you need
to display a different price, you will have to emulate the [subtotal],
[item-price], [item-subtotal], etc. fields with [item-list], [calc], 
and [currency] tags.  This snippet emulates the item-price tag for
a different price field <EM>layaway-price</EM>:
<p>
<XMP>
    [currency] [item-field layaway-price] [/currency]

</XMP>
<p>An item subtotal:
<p>
<XMP>
    [currency]
        [calc]
            [item-field layaway-price] * [item-quantity]
        [/calc]
    [/currency]

</XMP>
<p>A cart subtotal, using the item-list tag:
<p>
<XMP>
    [currency]
        [calc]
            [item-list layaway]
            ([item-field layaway-price] * [item-quantity]) +
            [/item-list]
            0
        [/calc]
    [/currency]

</XMP>
<p>The zero is needed because of the trailing plus sign left by the
iterative [item-list] tag.
<p>Even sales tax can be emulated if you use something like a
[data salestax [value state]] tag, and do some similar calculation.
That is left as an exercise for the user.
<p>Shipping and the [nitems] tag will still work properly with a
different price.
<p>You can also order items from a form, using the <EM>mv_order_item</EM>,

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_cartname_0">mv_cartname</A>
, and optional <EM>mv_order_quantity</EM> variables.

Advanced Multi-level Order Pages</A>
</H2>
An unlimited number of order checking profiles can be defined
with the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_orderprofile_0">OrderProfile</A>
 directive. This allows a multi-level ordering
process, with checking for format and validity at every stage.
<p>Specifications take the form of an order page variable (like name
or address), followed by an equals sign and one of five check types:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_required_1">
required</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
A non-blank value is required
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_mandatory_0">

</STRONG>
<DD>
Must be non-blank, and must have been specified on this
form, not a saved value from a previous form
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_phone_0">
phone</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
The field must look like a phone number, by a very
loose specification allowing numbers from all countries
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_phone_us_0">
phone_us</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Must have US phone number formatting, with area code
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_email_0">
email</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Rudimentary email address check, must have an '@' sign,
a name, and a minimal domain
<p>
</DL>
Also, there are three pragmas that can be used to change behavior:.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>&amp;fatal</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Set to '&amp;fatal=yes' if an error should generate
the error page.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>&amp;final</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Set to '&amp;final=yes' if a successful check should
cause the order to be placed.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>
<EM>&amp;set</EM>
</STRONG>
<DD>
Set a minivend variable to a value, i.e.  &amp;set=mv_email [value email].
This is usually placed at the end after a &amp;fatal pragma would have
caused the process to stop if there was an error.
<p>
</DL>
As an added measure of control, the specification is evaluated for the.special MiniVend tags to provide conditional setting of order
parameters. With the new [perl] [/perl] capability, quite complex checks
can be done.  Also, the name of the page to be displayed on an error can
be set in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mv_failpage_0">mv_failpage</A>
 variable.
<p>The following file specifies a simple check of formatted parameters:
<p>
<XMP>
 name=required
 address=required
 city=required
 state=required
 zip=required
 email=required
 phone_day=phone_us
 &fatal=yes
 email=email
 &set=mv_email [value email]
 &set=mv_successpage ord/shipping

</XMP>
<p>The profile above only performs the &amp;set directives if all of the
previous checks have passed -- the &amp;fatal=yes will stop processing after
the check of the email address if any of the previous checks failed.
<p>If you want to place multiple order profiles in the same file,
separate them with __END__, which must be on a line by itself.
Be careful, then they are interpreted in the order found, with 
the second file name not necessarily being the second profile.
(Which would be numbered 1, of course, just for clarity. At least
it is clear to a programmer.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_simple_0">
Simple Order Report File</A>
</H2>
The simple order report file, ``report'', defines the layout of the order
report which gets mailed on the completion of the order. For example,
<p>
<XMP>
              Order Date: $date
                    Name: $name
           Email address: $email
        Shipping address: $addr
        Town, State, Zip: $town, $state $zip
                 Country: $country

</XMP>
<p>Any input field from the order page can be included using the dollar
sign notation.
<p>To prevent a value from being included in the order report, just add it
to the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_reportignore_0">ReportIgnore</A>
 configuration directive.  
<p>MiniVend defines some values for use in the search form -- they begin
with 'mv_' and are automatically ignored.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_fully_configurable_0">
Fully-configurable Order Reports</A>
</H2>
You can specify a fully-configurable order report by setting the hidden
field ``mv_order_report'' to a legal MiniVend page. This page will be
interpolated with all MiniVend tags before sending by email.  The order
number as set by backend ordering is in the variable mv_order_number,
and available for your use.
<p>You could if you wish include HTML in the file, which will be interpreted
by many mailers, but you can choose to use standard ASCII format.
An example report is provided in the demo file &lt;pages/ord/report.html&gt;.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_order_3">
Order Receipts</A>
</H2>
If you specify a legal MiniVend page name in the ReceiptPage directive,
the user will be sent this page instead of the default ``confirmation''
file.  The file can of course be configured with all MiniVend tags, and
will be interpolated for the ordered items before they are deleted from
the user record.  If you want to have a different receipt for different
carts, set the <EM>mv_order_receipt</EM> variable in the form.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_the_5">
The Order Counter</A>
</H2>
An order counter can be enabled if the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_ordercounter_0">OrderCounter</A>
 directive
is set to a file name.  An incrementing count of all orders will be
kept and assigned as orders are placed.  By default, the number
starts at 0, but you can edit the file and change the default
starting number at any time.
<p>This capability is made possible by the File::CounterFile module,
available (as a part of the fine libwww modules) at the same place you
got MiniVend.  It is included with the distribution.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_customer_0">
Customer Input Fields</A>
</H2>
On the order (or shopping basket) page, by default order.html, you will
have a number of input fields allowing the customer to enter information
such as their name and address.  You can add more fields simply by
putting more input elements on the order.html page, and the information
will automatically be included in the order report. Input elements
should be written in this way:
<p>
<XMP>
    <input type="text" name="town" value="[value town]" size=30>

</XMP>
<p>Choose a name for this input field such as ``email'' for an email
address. Set the name attribute to the name you have chosen.
<p>The value attribute specifies the default value to give the field when
the page is displayed. Because the customer may enter information on
the order page, return to browsing, and come back to the order page,
you want the default value to be what was entered the first time. This
is done with the [value] element, which returns the last value of an
input field. Thus,
<p>
<XMP>
    value="[value name]"

</XMP>
<p>will evaluate to the name entered on the previous order screen, such
as:
<p>
<XMP>
       value="Jane Smith"

</XMP>
<p>which will be displayed by the browser.
<p>The size attributes specifies how many characters wide the input field
should be on the browser. You do not need to set this to fit the
longest possible value since the browser will scroll the field, but
you should set it large enough to be comfortable for the customer.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_product_0">
Product Pricing</A>
</H2>
MiniVend maintains a price in its database for every product. The price
field is the one required field in the product database -- it is necessary
to build the price routines.
<p>For speed, MiniVend builds the code that is used to determine a product's
price at catalog configuration time. If you choose to change a directive
that affects product pricing you must reconfigure the catalog.
<p>There are several ways that MiniVend can modify the price of a product during 
normal catalog operation. Several of them require that the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pricing_asc_0">pricing.asc</A>

file be present, and that you define a pricing database.  You do that by
placing the following directive in 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_cfg_0">catalog.cfg</A>
:
<p>
<XMP>
  Database  pricing pricing.asc 1

</XMP>
<p>Configurable directives and tags with regard to pricing:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>Quantity price breaks are configured by means of the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pricebreaks_0">PriceBreaks</A>
 and

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mixmatch_0">MixMatch</A>
 directives.  They require a field named specifically 'price'
in the pricing database.  The <STRONG>price</STRONG> field contains a space-separated
list of prices that correspond to the quantity levels defined in the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pricebreaks_0">PriceBreaks</A>
 directive. If quantity is to be applied to all items in
the shopping cart (as opposed to quantity of just that item) then the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_mixmatch_0">MixMatch</A>
 directive should be set to <STRONG>Yes</STRONG>.
<p>
<LI>Individual line-item prices can be adjusted according to the value of
their attributes.  See 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_priceadjustment_0">PriceAdjustment</A>
 and 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_commonadjust_0">CommonAdjust</A>
. The
pricing database <EM>must</EM> be defined unless you define the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_commonadjust_0">CommonAdjust</A>

behavior.
<p>
<LI>Product discounts for specific products, all products, or the entire
order can be configured with the [discount ...] tag. Discounts are applied
on a per-user basis -- you can gate the discount based on membership in a
club or other arbitrary means. See 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_product_1">Product Discounts</A>
.
<p>
</UL>
For example, if you decided to adjust the price of T-shirt part number.99-102 up 1.00 when the size is extra large and down 1.00 when the size is small,
you would have the following directives defined in &lt;catalog.cfg&gt;:
<p>
<XMP>
  Database          pricing pricing.asc 1
  UseModifier       size
  PriceAdjustment   size

</XMP>
<p>To enable the automatic modifier handling of MiniVend 3.0, you would
define a size field in products.asc:
<p>
<XMP>
  code    description   price    size
  99-102  T-Shirt       10.00    S=Small, M=Medium, L=Large*, XL=Extra Large

</XMP>
<p>You would place the proper tag within your [item-list] on the shopping-basket
or order page:
<p>
<XMP>
        [item-accessories size]

</XMP>
<p>In the pricing.asc database source, you would need:
<p>
<XMP>
  code      S       XL
  99-102    -1.00   1.00

</XMP>
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_item_1">
Item Attributes</A>
</H2>
MiniVend allows item attributes to be set for each ordered item. This
allows a size, color, or other modifier to be attached to a common
part number.  If multiple attributes are set, then they should be
separated by commas.  Previous attribute values can be saved by means
of a hidden field on a form, and multiple attributes for each item
can be <EM>stacked</EM> on top of each other.
<p>The configuration file directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_usemodifier_0">UseModifier</A>
 is used to set
the name of the modifier or modifiers. For example
<p>
<XMP>
    UseModifier        size,color

</XMP>
<p>will attach both a size and color attribute to each item code that
is ordered.
<p>As of MiniVend 2.02, setting the <EM>mv_separate_items</EM> or global
directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_separateitems_0">SeparateItems</A>
 places each ordered item on a separate
line, simplifying attribute handling.
<p>The modifier value is accessed in the [item-list] loop with the
[item-modifier attribute] tag, and form input fields are placed with the
[modifier-name attribute] tag.  This is similar to the way that quantity
is handled, except that attributes can be ``stacked'' by setting multiple
values in an input form.
<p>You cannot define a modifier name of 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_code_0">code</A>
 or <EM>quantity</EM>, as they
are already used.  You must be sure that no fields in your forms
have digits appended to their names if the variable is the same name
as the attribute name you select, as the [modifier-name size] variables
will be placed in the user session as the form variables size0, size1,
size2, etc. 
<p>You can use the [loop item,item,item] list to reference multiple display
or selection fields for modifiers (in MiniVend 3.0, you can have it
automatically generated --see below). The modifier value can then be
used to select data from an arbitrary database for attribute selection
and display.
<p>Below is a fragment from a shopping basket display form which 
shows a selectable size with ``sticky'' setting.  Note that this
would always be contained within the [item_list] [/item-list]
pair.
<p>
<XMP>
    <SELECT NAME="[modifier-name size]">
    <OPTION  [selected [modifier-name size] S]> S
    <OPTION  [selected [modifier-name size] M]> M
    <OPTION  [selected [modifier-name size] L]> L
    <OPTION [selected [modifier-name size] XL]> XL
    </SELECT>

</XMP>
<p>It could just as easily be done with a radiobutton group combined
with the [checked ...] tag.
<p>MiniVend 3.0 will automatically generate the above select box
when the [accessories size &lt;code&gt;] or [item-accessories size]
tags are called. They have the syntax:
<p>
<XMP>
   [item_accessories attribute*, type*, field*, database*, name*]
 
   [accessories code attribute*, type*, field*, database*, name*]
 
   code          Not needed for item-accessories, this is the
                 product code of the item to reference.
 
   attribute     The item attribute as specified in the UseModifier
                 configuration directive.  Typical are "size" or
                 "color".
 
   type          The action to be taken. The default is 'select', which
                 builds an HTML select form entry for the attribute.
                 Also recognized is 'multiple', which generates a
                 multiple-selection dropdown list, and 'show', which
                 just shows the list of possible attributes.
 
   field         The database field name to be used to build the
                 entry (usually a field in the products database).
                 Defaults to a field named the same as the attribute.
 
   database      The database to find B<field> in, defaults to the
                 first products file where the item code is found.
 
   name          Name of the form variable to use if a form is being
                 built.  Defaults to mv_order_B<attribute> -- i.e.
                 if the attribute is B<size>, the form variable will
                 be named B<mv_order_size>.

</XMP>
<p>When called with an attribute, the database is consulted and looks for
a comma-separated list of attribute options.  They take the form:
<p>
<XMP>
    name=Label Text, name=Label Text*

</XMP>
<p>The label text is optional -- if none is given, the <STRONG>name</STRONG> will
be used.
<p>If an asterisk is the last character of the label text, the item is
the default selection.  If no default is specified, the first will be
the default.  An example:
<p>
<XMP>
    [item_accessories color]

</XMP>
<p>This will search the product database for a field named ``color''. If
an entry ``beige=Almond, gold=Harvest Gold, White*, green=Avocado'' is found,
a select box like this will be built:
<p>
<XMP>
    <SELECT NAME="mv_order_color">
    <OPTION VALUE="beige">Almond
    <OPTION VALUE="gold">Harvest Gold
    <OPTION SELECTED>White
    <OPTION VALUE="green">Avocado
    </SELECT>

</XMP>
<p>In combination with the <EM>mv_order_item</EM> and <EM>mv_order_quantity</EM> variables
this can be used to allow entry of an attribute at time of order.
<p>If used in an item list, and the user has changed the value, the generated
select box will automatically retain the current value the user has selected.
<p>The value can then be displayed with [item-modifier size] on the
order report, order receipt, or any other page containing an
[item_list]. 
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_product_1">
Product Discounts</A>
</H2>
Product discounts can be set upon display of any page. The discounts
apply only to the customer receiving them, and are of one of three types:
<p>
<XMP>
    1. A discount for one particular item code (key is the item-code)
    2. A discount applying to all item codes (key is ALL_ITEMS)
    3. A discount applied after all items are totaled
       (key is ENTIRE_ORDER)

</XMP>
<p>The discounts are specified via a formula. The formula is scanned for
the variables <STRONG>$q</STRONG> and <STRONG>$s</STRONG>, which are substituted for with the item
<EM>quantity</EM> and <EM>subtotal</EM> respectively. In the case of the item and
all items discount, the formula must evaluate to a new subtotal for all
items <EM>of that code</EM> that are ordered. The discount for the entire
order is applied to the entire order, and would normally be a monetary
amount to subtract or a flat percentage discount.
<p>Discounts are applied to the effective price of the product, including
any quantity discounts.
<p>To apply a straight 20<STRONG>% </STRONG>discount to all items:
<p>
<XMP>
    [discount ALL_ITEMS] $s * .8 [/discount]

</XMP>
<p>To take 25<STRONG>% </STRONG>off of only item 00-342:
<p>
<XMP>
    [discount 00-342] $s * .75 [/discount]

</XMP>
<p>To subtract <STRONG>$5</STRONG>.00 from the customer's order:
<p>
<XMP>
    [discount ENTIRE_ORDER] $s - 5 [/discount]

</XMP>
<p>Perl code can be used to apply the discounts.  Here is an example of a
discount for item code 00-343 which prices the <EM>second</EM> one ordered at
1 cent:
<p>
<XMP>
    [discount 00-343]
    return $s if $q == 1;
    my $p = $s/$q;
    my $t = ($q - 1) * $p;
    $t .= 0.01;
    return $t;
    [/discount]

</XMP>
<p>If you want to display the discount amount, use the [calc] capability.
This example calculates the amount of the discount for all items in
the current shopping cart:
<p>
<XMP>

<A NAME="minivend_sales_0">
Sales Tax</A>
</H2>
MiniVend allows calculation of sales tax on a straight percentage basis,
with certain items allowed to be tax-exempt.  To enable this feature,
the directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_salestax_2">SalesTax</A>
 is initialized with the name of a field (or
fields) on the order form.  Commonly, this is zipcode and/or state:
<p>
<XMP>
    SalesTax    zip,state

</XMP>
<p>This being done, MiniVend assumes the presence of a file 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_salestax_asc_0">salestax.asc</A>
,
which contains a database with the percentages.  Each line of 

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_salestax_asc_0">salestax.asc</A>
 should be a code (again, usually a five-digit zip or
a two letter state) followed by a tab, then a percentage. Example:
<p>
<XMP>
    default 0
    45056   .0525
    61821   .0725
    61801   .075
    IL      .0625
    OH      .0525
    WA      .08

</XMP>
<p>Based on the user's entry of information in the order form, MiniVend
will look up (for our example SalesTax directive) first the zip, then
the state, and apply the percentage to the SUBTOTAL of the order.  The
subtotal will include any taxable items, and will also include the
shipping cost if the state/zip is included in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_taxshipping_0">TaxShipping</A>
 directive.
It will add the percentage, then make that available with the [salestax]
tag for display on the order form. If no match is found, the entry
'default' is applied -- that is normally 0, but can be anything.
<p>If business is being done on a national basis, it is now common to have
to collect sales tax for multiple states.  If you are doing so, it is possible
to subscribe to a service which issues regular updates of the sales tax
percentages -- usually by quarterly or monthly subscription.  Such a
database should be easily converted to MiniVend format -- but some systems
are rather convoluted, and it will be well to check and see if the
program can export to a flat ASCII file format based on zip code.
<p>If some items are not taxable, then you must set up a field in your
database which indicates that. You then place the <STRONG>name</STRONG> of that field
in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_nontaxablefield_0">NonTaxableField</A>
 directive. If the field for that item
evaluates true on a yes-no basis (i.e. is set to 'yes', 'y', 1, or the
like), sales tax will not be applied to the item. If it evaluates false,
it will be taxed.
<p>If your state taxes shipping, use the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_taxshipping_0">TaxShipping</A>
 directive.
Utah and Nevada are known to tax shipping -- there may be others.

SHIPPING</A>
</H1>
MiniVend allows the addition of a flat shipping charge with
the

 directive.  Most catalogs have more elaborate
requirements, requiring use of the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_shipping_1">SHIPPING</A>
 capability
of MiniVend.
<p>To enable custom shipping, enter the default field to use in the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_customshipping_0">CustomShipping</A>
 directive:
<p>
<XMP>
    CustomShipping  weight

</XMP>
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> Before MiniVend 2.0, there could only be one field used
to set the criteria.  As of MiniVend 2.0, the entry in the shipping file
which is <EM>exactly the same</EM> as the value of the mv_shipmode variable
will be used to determine the field criteria for the shipping method.
This allows 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_weight_0">weight</A>
 to be used for one mode, while <EM>price</EM> or
<EM>quantity</EM> is used for another.  The CustomShipping directive only

mode specification.
<p>

If a default shipping mode other than 'default' is desired, enter
it into the

 directive:
<p>
<XMP>
    DefaultShipping     UPSG

<p>This will make the  entry on the order form checked by default when the
user starts the order process, if it is put in the form:
<p>
<XMP>
  <INPUT TYPE=RADIO NAME=mv_shipmode VALUE=upsg [checked mv_shipmode upsg]> 

</XMP>
<p>To force a choice by the user, you can make mv_shipmode a required form
variable (with 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_requiredfields_0">RequiredFields</A>

<LI>The base code is selected by reading the value of mv_shipmode
in the user session.  If it has not been explicitly set, either
by means of the

 directive or by setting the

<p>
<LI>The criterion field is found -- if it is quantity, then it
is the total quantity of items on the order form. If it is any
other name, it is selected from the product database field of
that name.  If the lookup fails, a zero cost will be returned,
and an error is sent to the catalog error log.

<LI>Entries in the shipping database that begin with the same
string as the shipping mode are examined. If none is found,
a zero cost is returned and an error is sent to the catalog error log.

<LI>The value of the criteria TIMES THE QUANTITY of the item is determined,
and if it falls with in the minimum and maximum, the cost is then
applied.  This will be called the accumulated criterion.

Here is an example shipping file using all of the methods of.determining shipping cost.
<p>NOTE: The columns are lined up for your reading convenience, the actual
entries should have ONE tab between fields.

  fedex  FedEx       quantity  1   99999999  s fedex_cost ;[value country]

</XMP>
<p><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> that the first entry in each class does not have a number appended
to it.  That is the entry used to determine the criteria (quantity,
weight, price, etc) and the text for the [shipping_desc] tag. It is also
used to apply the cost if the value of the criteria is less than 1.
<p>
<UL>
<LI>If the user selected RPS, (code rpsg), and the quantity on the order
was 3, the cost of 7.00 from <EM>rpsg1</EM> would be applied.  If the
quantity were 7, the next entry from <EM>rpsg2</EM> would be selected, for a
cost of 10.00.  If the quantity were 15, <EM>rpsg3</EM> would be selected, and
the quantity of 15 multiplied by 0.95, for a total cost of 14.25.
<p>
<LI>The second one, <EM>usps</EM>, is a more complicated formula -- using price as the
criteria. If the total price of all items in the shopping cart (same as
[subtotal] without quantity price breaks in place) is from 1 to 50, the
cost will be 7.00 plus 10<STRONG>% </STRONG>of the order. If the total is from 50.01
to 100, the cost will be 12.00 plus 9<STRONG>% </STRONG>of the order total. If the
cost is 100.01 or greater, then 5<STRONG>% </STRONG>of the order total will be used
as the shipping cost.
<p>
<LI>The third, <EM>upsg</EM>, is a special case. It specifies a UPS lookup based on your
UPS zone and two required values (and two optional arguments):
<p>
<XMP>
    1. Weight (careful, always use weight for this one!)
    2. The zip/postal code of the recipient, of which only
       the first three digits are used.
    3. A fixed amount to add to the cost found in the UPS
       tables (use 0 as a placeholder if specifying roundup)
    4. If set to 'round', will round the cost up to the next
       integer monetary unit.

</XMP>
<p>If the cost returned is zero, the reason will be placed as an error
message in the session variable ship_message (available as [data session
ship_message]).
<p>UPS weights are always rounded up if any fraction is present. 
<p>The routines use standard UPS lookup tables.  First, the UPS Zone
file must be present.  That is a standard UPS document,
<EM>specific to your area</EM>, that you must obtain from UPS and enter into and make
available to MiniVend in TAB-delimited format. (As of March 1997, you
can use the standard .csv file distributed by UPS on their web site at
www.ups.com.) You specify it with the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_upszonefile_0">UpsZoneFile</A>
 directive -- it is
usually named something like <EM>NNN.csv</EM>, where NNN is the first three
digits of the originating zip code.
<p>Second, you must obtain the cost tables from UPS (again, you can get them from
www.ups.com) and place them into a MiniVend database. That database, its
identifier specified with the first argument (upsg in the example) of the cost
specification, is consulted to determine the UPS cost for that weight and
rate schedule.  See the sample demo for an implementation.
<p>You can append a simple shipping cost qualification to a UPS lookup. If
any additional parameters are present after the five usual ones used for
UPS lookup, they will be interpreted as a Perl subroutine call. The
syntax is the same as if it was encased in the tag [perl sub] [/perl],
but the following substitutions are made prior to the call:
<p>
<XMP>
    @@COST@@  is replaced with whatever the UPS lookup returned
    @@GEO@@   is replaced with the zip (or other geo code)
    @@ADDER@@ is replaced with the defined adder
    @@TYPE@@  is replaced with the UPS shipping type
    @@TOTAL@@ is replaced with the total weight

</XMP>
<p>
<LI>The last entry, <EM>fedex</EM>, uses a named subroutine. The example is
designed to work with this subroutine defined in catalog.cfg:
<p>
<PRE>
        Sub &lt;&lt;EOF
        fedex_cost {
                my(<STRONG>$country</STRONG>) = <STRONG>@_</STRONG>;
                my <STRONG>$cost</STRONG>;
                if(<STRONG>$country</STRONG> =~ /^usa?<STRONG>$/</STRONG>i) {
                        <STRONG>$cost</STRONG> = 20;
                }
                else {
                        <STRONG>$cost</STRONG> = 50;
                }
                return <STRONG>$cost</STRONG>;
        }
        EOF

</PRE>
<p><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The text above appears indented, but in the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_cfg_0">catalog.cfg</A>
 file
it must begin at the beginning of the line. Also, make sure you upload
in ASCII mode -- carriage returns are not tolerated.
<p>It will simply return a cost of 20 if the country the user has entered is
US or USA -- and return 50 otherwise.  Obviously much more complicated
routines can be defined.  Read the following only if you know Perl well
and/or are not of faint heart.
<p>You can call named subroutines with any of the methods, defined with
[set name] your_perl_code_here [/set], 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_sub_1">Sub</A>
, or 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_globalsub_0">GlobalSub</A>
.
<p>If parameters are specified, separated by commas, they will be taken as
either fixed values or as database fields to be sent to the subroutine
in an anonymous hash keyed on the item code (for each item in the
*current* shopping cart).
<p>If a database other than the products database is to be used, the database
name should be prepended with a colon (<EM>:</EM>) separator. If a key other
than the item code is to be used, it should be appended with a semi-colon
separator.
<p>To send fixed value to the subroutine (appended to the call reference
as an array of fixed scalar parameters), begin the parameter with a
semicolon. <STRONG>They will be appended globally after the hash reference</STRONG>.
<p>Examples
<p>
<XMP>
  # Sends the weight of each item from the products database
  
  weight 
  
  
  # Sends the value of the handling field from the
  # special database for each item
  
  special:handling 
  
   
  # Sends the value of the 'adder' field from the special
  # database, for the value the user has entered for 'country'
  # The spaces around the separators are OK
 
  special : adder ; [value country] 
  
 
  # Sends a fixed parameter of 20 to the subroutine
  
  ;20

</XMP>
<p>The parameters are interpreted for MiniVend tags before being parsed.
Here is a complete example:
<p>
<XMP>
   s item_cost weight,modes:[value mv_shipmode];[value country], ;20, ;25
  
  items in the shopping cart:  00-0011 19=202
  
  ------- product database  ----
  
  code    weight   description      price
  00-0011   8      The Mona Lisa    1000
  19-202    12     American Gothic  800
  
  
  ------- modes database  ----
  
  code    upsg  upsb  upsr  postal_air postal_surface  `
  UK        0    0     0       1            1 

</XMP>
<p>will call the subroutine <EM>item_cost</EM>, and will send the weight of each
item, along with the value of the modes database column corresponding to
the shipping mode the user has selected, keyed with the value of <EM>country</EM>
on their order form.  If the user has selected mode postal_air, and is
in the country coded as <EM>UK</EM>, the subroutine will be called as if it
was:
<p>
<XMP>
      item_cost( {
                    '00-0011' => {postal_air => '1', weight => '8'}, 
                    '19-202' => {postal_air => '1', weight => '12'},
                 }, 20, 25 )

</XMP>
<p>If the undefined value is returned by the routine, the next shipping mode
will be tried.  If a non-numeric string value is returned, its value
will be placed as an error message in the session variable ship_message
(available as [data session ship_message]) and a zero cost will be returned.
If any number or the empty string is returned, it will be used as the
shipping cost (even 0).

<A NAME="minivend_ssl_0">
SSL SECURITY</A>
</H1>
MiniVend has several features that enable secure ordering via SSL
(Secure Sockets Layer). Despite their mystique, SSL servers are actually
quite easy to operate.  The difference between the standard HTTP server
and the SSL HTTPS server, from the standpoint of the user, is only in
the encryption and the specification of the URL -- https: is used for the
URL protocol specification instead of the usual http: designation.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG>  MiniVend attempts to perform operations securely,
but no guarantees or warranties of any kind are made! Since MiniVend
comes with Perl source, it is possible to modify the program to create
bad security problems. One way to minimize this possibility is to record
digital signatures, using MD5 or PGP, of <EM>minivend.pl</EM>,

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
, and all modules included in minivend.pl (standard ones are
Vend/Server.pm, Vend/Imagemap.pm, Vend/Http.pm, Vend/lock.pm, and
possibly Des). Check them on a regular basis to ensure they have not
been changed.
<p>MiniVend uses the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_secureurl_0">SecureURL</A>
 directive to set the base URL for secure
transactions, and the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_vendurl_0">VendURL</A>
 directive for normal non-secure transactions.
Secure URLs can be enabled for forms through the [process_target action secure]
element.
<p>MiniVend incorporates additional security for credit card numbers.  Any field
on the order form which has <STRONG>credit_card</STRONG> in its name will not be written
to disk unless it is encrypted. An external encryption program, such
as pgp(1) or des(1) can be used.
<p><STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> The internal Des encryption mode is no longer supported in
MiniVend 2.02 and higher.  Try PGP instead -- it is more secure and
easier to use.
<p>To accept credit_card fields, you need to define the directive

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_creditcardauto_0">CreditCardAuto</A>
 to <EM>yes</EM>.  
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_encryptprogram_0">EncryptProgram</A>
 also needs
to be defined with some value, one which will, with hope,
encrypt the number.  PGP is now recommended above all other
encryption program. The entries should look something like:
<p>
<XMP>
  CreditCardAuto   Yes
  EncryptProgram   /usr/local/bin/pgp -feat sales@company.com

</XMP>
<p>See 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_creditcardauto_0">CreditCardAuto</A>

Administrative Pages</A>
</H2>
With MiniVend's 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_globalsub_0">GlobalSub</A>

can be implemented with Perl subroutines. And with the new

administrator may use it.
<p>In addition, you can create a file in any MiniVend page subdirectory
called .access.  If that file is present and non-zero in size,
any pages in that directory are only available to users who have the
REMOTE_USER CGI variable set (which means they have given a username and
password, ala normal HTTP Basic Authorization). This is a way to provide
``subscription-only'' pages that are only available to logged-in users.

<A NAME="minivend_using_1">
Using Frames</A>
</H2>
MiniVend fully supports frames, the proposed extension to HTML 3.0. (Currently
only Netscape 2.0 and above browsers support frames.) Frames significantly
enhance the electronic catalog experience, since the user can maintain
a context -- with a search frame, a product details frame, a table-of-contents
frame, etc. The demo included with MiniVend is based on frames, though if
you access it with a non-frame browser it will operate perfectly well.
<p>Frames are accessed by adding a TARGET element to a HREF, naming
the frame that the referenced URL should be placed in. MiniVend
produces targets with the pagetarget and areatarget elements, which
send target tags if frames are enabled (by a [frames_on] element.
Any frame name can be used, including the special frames of _top, _blank,
_parent, and _self.
<p>As shown in the demo pages, the best way to accommodate both types of
browsers is by having an <EM>index.html</EM> page that sets the beginning
frame set.  The &lt;FRAMESET&gt; and &lt;FRAME&gt; tags will be ignored by standard
browsers, which will read the HTML between the &lt;NOFRAMES&gt; and &lt;/NOFRAMES&gt;
tags below.
<p>The format of the first set of URLs passed to the frames is important - only
ONE MiniVend link must be called.  That sets the session ID for the user. If
two URLs were called, MiniVend would assign two session IDs to the user,
scrambling the context of their navigation.  From this single access,
all further references to MiniVend are made, though after the first access
multiple frame targets can be referenced.
<p>This first MiniVend page that is accessed (with a frame browser) should
contain a [frames_on] element.  It is the only page that need (or should)
contain a [frames_on], which is persistent throughout the session. This
page should never be seen by a non-frame browser.
<p>Subsequent accesses to MiniVend URLs will now contain the proper session
information, and as long as pagetarget or page elements are used to
pass the URLs, context will be maintained.
<p>The [pagetarget page frame] element is used to pass target tags in hyperlinks.
The [areatarget page frame] element is used to pass target tags in imagemaps.
The [frames_on] and [frames_off] elements enable and disable frame operation.
The [framebase frame] element sets a base target for a page.
<p>See the sample demo pages:
<p>
<XMP>
    greet.html      Starting frame for frames-based browsers - has [frames_on]
    nf_greet.html   Turns off frames -- has [frames_off]
    reframe.html    Re-enables frames after they have been turned off

Changing output frame in a form</A>
</H2>
If you want to send output to different frames based on input
from the user, you can set the <EM>mv_change_frame</EM> variable. If found
<EM>in the current form</EM>, a <EM>Window-Target:</EM> header will be sent
to route the HTML output to the frame named in <EM>mv_change_frame</EM>.
<p>You can use 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_one_click_0">One-click Multiple Variables</A>
 to set the target if you
wish.
<p>
<XMP>
  <INPUT TYPE="submit" name="mv_todo" value="Search">
  <INPUT TYPE="submit" name="mv_click" value="Continue Shopping">
  [set Continue Shopping]
  mv_todo=return
  mv_nextpage=browse
  mv_change_frame=_top
  [/set]

</XMP>
<p>The above snippet will, when placed in a MiniVend form, send the output
of a <STRONG>Search</STRONG> submission to the current default frame, but when
<STRONG>Continue Shopping</STRONG> is selected the output will will go to the page
<EM>browse.html</EM> with the page routed to the top level frame for the
current browser window.
<p>If you are setting a target with the <EM>[process_target target]</EM> tag, you
will either have to make that target <EM>none</EM> or set the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_scratch_0">scratch</A>

<EM>mv_ignore_frame</EM> on the page at time of display.  Either will prevent
conflicting window targets from being sent.

<A NAME="minivend_body_1">
Body and Buttonbar Control</A>
</H2>
MiniVend provides centralized page color and imagemap control through
use of the [body n] and [buttonbar n] elements. It also can place a random
message from a series of messages with the [random] element, and embed
help messages with the [help item] element.
<p>The [body n] element selects a color scheme -- numbered from 1 to 15 --
that is set by the Mv_Background, Mv_TextColor, Mv_BgColor,
Mv_LinkColor, and Mv_VlinkColor directives. Each can contain up to 15
parameters, after an opening BEGIN. Here is an example:
<p>
<XMP>
    Mv_Background  BEGIN /images/blue_pap.gif
    Mv_BgColor     BEGIN none steelblue white
    Mv_LinkColor   BEGIN none white black
    Mv_TextColor   BEGIN none ltgreen blue
    Mv_VlinkColor  BEGIN none orange purple

</XMP>
<p>The above sequence set in the catalog.cfg file, defines three color
schemes, accessed with [body 1], [body 2], and [body 3] elements in
MiniVend pages.  The first scheme uses the file <EM>/images/blue_pap.gif</EM>
as the background pattern, and keeps the user's default colors for
everything else.  It is called by a [body 1] element, which when
expanded becomes &lt;BODY BACKGROUND="/images/blue_pap.gif&gt;.
<p>The second scheme defines no background pattern (there is only one file
in the Mv_Background directive), but defines a background color of 'steelblue',
with a text color of white, a link color of light green, and a visited link
color of orange. It is accessed by the [body 2] element, which when expanded
becomes &lt;BODY BGCOLOR=``steelblue'' TEXT=``white'' LINK=``ltgreen'' VLINK=``orange''&gt;.
<p>The third color scheme is similar to the second, except defines
white-black-blue-purple for the four colors.  It is accessed with
a [body 3] element.
<p>If there is no defined scheme for a body element (as there wouldn't be if
you put [body 4] in a page with the above schemes defined) MiniVend
simply outputs a standard &lt;BODY> tag.
<p>The user can also define their own colors if the Mv_customcolors
variable is set (upon a form submission).  See the supplied

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_control_0">control.html</A>
 page for an example of how to set custom colors.
<p>Image maps can be supplied and similarly controlled with the [buttonbar n]
series of tags.  They are defined with the ButtonBars directive 
in catalog.cfg, and take the form of a series of
file names in MiniVend format -- i.e., relative to the PageDir and
without a .html extension. To use the buttonbars, create a file 
with an IMG directive set with the USEMAP element and an associated
client-side image map (defined with &lt;MAP&gt; &lt;/MAP&gt;. The [areatarget]
or [area] tags are used to set the URLs. An example:
<p>
<XMP>
    <IMG SRC="/sample/images/artbar0.gif" USEMAP="#ARTBAR0">
    <MAP NAME=ARTBAR0>
    <AREA COORDS="198,0,278,20" HREF="[areatarget fr_sel search]">
    <AREA COORDS="303,0,363,20" HREF="[areatarget fr_search search]">
    <AREA COORDS="388,0,442,20" HREF="[areatarget fr_greet main]">
    <AREA COORDS="473,0,537,20" HREF="[areatarget control main]">
    <AREA COORDS="0,0,560,20" NOHREF>
    </MAP>

</XMP>
<p>If the above were saved in the file PageDir/bars/artbar0.html (where PageDir
is your MiniVend pages directory), you would be able to access this
imagemap in your pages with a [buttonbar 0] tag, at least after MiniVend
read this line in the configuration file:
<p>
<XMP>
    ButtonBars  bars/artbar0 bars/artbar1 bars/artbar2

</XMP>
<p>The above entry allows you to define three imagemaps and access them in
your pages simply as [buttonbar 0], [buttonbar 1], and [buttonbar 2]. The
advantage of this scheme is central definition of a series of button bars
with only a few tags -- if you change your page colors or mapping, you
need only change one file and the change will roll over to all of your
catalog pages. Since some installations can number in the thousands
of catalog pages, using the pre-defined buttonbars can save a lot of
editing. (Server-side includes cannot be used to achieve the same thing
with MiniVend, since they wouldn't have the proper URLs.)
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_integrated_0">
Integrated Image Maps</A>
</H2>
Imagemaps can also be defined on forms, with the special form variable
<EM>mv_todo.map</EM>.  A series of map actions can be defined --
the action specified in the <EM>default</EM> entry will be applied if none
of the other coordinates match. The image is specified with a standard
HTML 2.0 form field of type <EM>IMAGE</EM>.  Here is an example:
<p>
<XMP>
 <INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="rect submit 0,0 100,20">
 <INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="rect cancel 290,2 342,18">
 <INPUT TYPE="HIDDEN" NAME="mv_todo.map" VALUE="default refresh">
 <INPUT TYPE="IMAGE" NAME="mv_todo" SRC="url_of_image">

</XMP>
<p>All of the actions will be combined together into one image map with
NCSA-style functionality -- see the NCSA imagemap documentation for
details -- except that MiniVend form actions are defined instead
of URLs.  The standard actions are:
<p>
<XMP>
 submit   Submit order
 refresh  Refresh order page (update quantities, etc.)
 cancel   Cancel order and wipe credit card numbers
 return   Go to previous page (or page defined in mv_nextpage variable)

The [random] element, in conjunction with the

<H1> 
<A NAME="minivend_static_1">
Static Page Building</A>
</H1>
MiniVend now has a complete implementation of a static page building
facilty. It allows you to build a parallel page tree <EM>completely in HTML</EM>,
and most importantly, keeps track of all of the URLs for you. It means
that MiniVend, whether the page on the browser was called dynamically
or statically, will call the appropriate page for you.  This can mean
huge performance gains in catalogs with lots of pages in the browsing
structure, for any statically built pages never have to call MiniVend.
This improves performance and decreases server load.
<p>You can also use it to build page trees that are scannable by a search
engine spider.
<p>It is invoked when starting the MiniVend server by passing the extra parameters
<EM>-build shop</EM> to the <EM>start</EM> or <EM>restart</EM> command. MiniVend will scan
the entire page structure, testing each page to see if it has any
<EM>dynamic elements</EM>.  Dynamic elements are those MiniVend tags which
depend on user session status, like the contents of the shopping cart,
conditional tests on user variables, or databases marked as dynamic
with the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_dynamicdata_0">DynamicData</A>
 directive. If a page has dynamic elements,
it will not be built statically.
<p>Tags which cause static building to fail are:
<p>
<XMP>
  [cart ...]           [if validcc ...]       [salestax]
  [checked ...]        [if value ...]         [salestax]
  [data ...]*          [item_list]            [scratch ...]
  [default ...]        [last_page]            [selected ...]
  [discount]           [lookup ..]            [shipping]
  [frames_on|off]      [loop-data ...]*       [shipping_desc]
  [if data ...]*       [loop-field ...]*      [sql set]
  [if discount ...]    [msql set]             [subtotal]
  [if items ...]       [nitems]               [total_cost]
  [if scratch ...]     [nitems]               [value ...]
  [if session ...]     [perl]
  
  * Only if database referenced is dynamic

</XMP>
<p>In addition, if a [search_list] references dynamic items, it will
also prevent a search from being cached or built statically.
<p>Pages are also searched for static [page scan/...] searches, and
those searches are built statically if appropriate.  They are placed
in the pages scan1.html on up, so don't name any of your pages scan
and then digits if you want to avoid clashing.
<p>A page marked as an 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_adminpage_0">AdminPage</A>
 will not be statically built or cached.
<p>Pages are marked for static build in one of two ways:
<p>
<UL>
<LI>If you want all pages to be statically built when possible, set the

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_cfg_0">catalog.cfg</A>
 directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticall_0">StaticAll</A>
 to yes.  MiniVend will scan all
pages and see if they can be built.  If you have pages and/or directories
which you don't want scanned, use the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_nocache_0">NoCache</A>
 directive to disable it.
<p>
<LI>If you want only certain pages to be statically built, you can either
individually mark each one with the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticpage_0">StaticPage</A>
 directive, or you may
set a 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticpattern_0">StaticPattern</A>
 which encompasses pages to be built statically.
<p>
</UL>
In addition, you can build all possible on-the-fly pages out of the.database if the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticfly_0">StaticFly</A>
 directive is set. This <EM>is</EM> subject to
the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticpattern_0">StaticPattern</A>
 as well, so you could build only a portion of the
database if you wished. Obviously catalogs that have many thousands of
items should be careful about use of 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticfly_0">StaticFly</A>
.
<p>The names of pages that are statically built are maintained in the file
<EM>.static</EM>, located in the MiniVend 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_pagedir_0">PageDir</A>
. This is how MiniVend
knows which pages should be referenced with static URLs.
<p>The 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticdir_0">StaticDir</A>
 directive defines the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_file_1">file path</A>
 to the root
of the page structure that will be built. If blank, it will use
the directory <EM>static</EM> in the catalog root, which can then be copied
to the appropriate place in HTML document space.
<p><STRONG>WARNING:</STRONG> Any existing pages that are present will be overwritten!
<p>The 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticpath_0">StaticPath</A>
 directive defines the <STRONG>URL path</STRONG> to the root
of the page structure that will be built.  It is relative to
HTTP document root, and must obviously be the URL path to 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticdir_0">StaticDir</A>
.
Default is /, or DocumentRoot.
<p>The 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_staticsuffix_0">StaticSuffix</A>
 directive defines the suffix of the files that
will be built. The default is <EM>.html</EM>. DOSites might want to make
it <EM>.htm</EM>, and if you wished to have the files parsed for server
side includes you might use <EM>.shtml</EM>.
<p>If you wish to build the catalog pages offline (recommended on servers
that are used by multiple catalogs), you can use the command:
<p>
<XMP>
   start -test -build shop

</XMP>
<p>where <EM>shop</EM> is the name of the catalog to be built. (Multiple <EM>-build name</EM>
directives can be used to build more than one catalog.)
<p><STRONG>TIP:</STRONG> StaticFly only builds products from the first products database.
If you are using multiple <EM>ProductFiles</EM>, you can build for all in turn by
selectively changing the <EM>ProductFiles</EM> directive temporarily while building
off line.

<A NAME="minivend_minivend_2">
MINIVEND CONFIGURATION FILES</A>

MiniVend can and usually does run multiple catalogs on the
same server.  If no

 directives are present in the main

<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
 file, the server will read only a single catalog's
information from the one 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_minivend_cfg_0">minivend.cfg</A>
 file, just as in
early versions of the program.
<p>You normally call configuration directives with the directive as the
first word on the line, with it's value or values following. Leading
whitespace is stripped from the value.
<p>You may call additional files with a rudimentary <EM>#include file</EM>
statement.  The directives called with includes are always appended
at the end of the main configuration file. Though order is rarely
important in the configuration files, you must define any directory
settings in the main configuration file near the top if they are to
be used to base the file calls of subsequent directives. Files are
relative to the catalog directory (or MiniVend software directory, if
in the main minivend.cfg file).
<p>You can also use a type of ``here document'' to specify MiniVend directives,
with the usual &lt;&lt;MARKER syntax.  No semicolon is used to terminate the
marker.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_server_0">

The VendRoot directory, specified in the main program minivend.pl, is
the default location of all of the MiniVend program, configuration,
special, and library files. Unless changed in minivend.pl, the main
MiniVend server configuration file will be minivend.cfg in the VendRoot

listed under 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_3">Catalog Configuration File</A>
 are operative for the

<p>Otherwise, there are only a few directives that are defined in the

 file.
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="minivend_catalog_2">
Catalog</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Specifies a catalog that can run using this MiniVend server.
There are three required parameters, separated by spaces and/or tabs.
<p>The first is the name of the catalog -- it will be referred
to as that name in error, warning, and informational messages.
<p>The second is the base directory of the catalog. If the directory
does not contain a 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_catalog_cfg_0">catalog.cfg</A>
 file, the server will report
an error and refuse to start.
<p>The third directive is very important to get right -- it is the
SCRIPT_NAME of the vlink program that runs the catalog.  It must
be unique from other CGI program paths that run on this server --
that is how the catalog is selected for operation.
<p>
<XMP>
    Catalog    sample   /home/minivend/sample  /cgi-bin/sample

</XMP>
<p>As of MiniVend 3.0, you can specify any number of alias script names
as additional parameters. This allows the calling path to be different
while still calling the same catalog -- it is most probably useful
when calling an SSL server or a members-only exectable that requires
a username/password via HTTP Basic authorization.  All branched links
will be called using the aliased URL.
<p>In addition, if you set the global directive 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_fullurl_0">FullUrl</A>
 to <EM>yes</EM>,
you can (and must in all catalogs) specify the server name that
will call the catalog.  This allows you to have many virtual domains,

    }
    EOF

</PRE>
<p>As with Perl ``here documents'', the EOF (or other end marker) must be the 
ONLY thing on the line, with no leading or trailing white space. Do not
append a semicolon to the marker. (The above appears indented -- it
should not be that way in the file!)

<A NAME="minivend_creditcardauto_0">
CreditCardAuto</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
If set to <EM>Yes</EM>, enables the encryption and saving of 
credit card information. In order for this to work properly, the
EncryptProgram directive must be set to properly encode the field.  The
best way to set EncryptProgram is with PGP in the ASCII armor mode (the
option set '-feat' is used).
<p>This option uses the following standard fields on MiniVend order
processing forms:
<p>
<XMP>
    mv_credit_card_number      The actual credit card number, which
                               will be wiped from memory if it verifies
                               as a valid Amex, Visa, MC, or Discover
                               card number.
    mv_credit_card_exp_all     The expiration date, as a text field in
                               the form MM/YY (will take a four-digit
                               year as well).  If it is not present,
                               the fields mv_credit_card_exp_month and
                               mv_credit_card_exp_year are looked at. 
                               It is set by MiniVend when the card
                               validation returns, if not previously
                               set.
    mv_credit_card_exp_month   The expiration date month, used if the
                               mv_credit_card_exp_all field is not present.
                               It is set by MiniVend when the card
                               validation returns, if not previously
                               set.
    mv_credit_card_exp_year    The expiration date year, used if the
                               mv_credit_card_exp_all field is not present.
                               It is set by MiniVend when the card
                               validation returns, if not previously
                               set.
    mv_credit_card_error       Set by MiniVend to indicate the error
                               if the card does not validate properly.
                               The error message is not too enlightening
                               if validation is the problem.
    mv_credit_card_info        Set by MiniVend to the encrypted card
                               information if the card validates
                               properly. If PGP is used in ASCII armor
                               mode, this field can be placed on the
                               order report and embedded in the order
                               email, replete with markers. This allows
                               a secure order to be read for content,
                               without exposing the credit card number
                               to risk.
    mv_credit_card_valid       Set by Minivend to true, or 1, if the the
                               card validates properly. Set to 0 otherwise.

<p>Starting at MiniVend 2.0, it is possible for multiple catalogs to share
the same session file.  This allows a ``mall'' to be set up where many
storefronts use a common ordering point.  It would be wise to share the
order pages, salestax database,  and shipping database if that is the
case.  You will also need to set 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_sessionlockfile_0">SessionLockFile</A>

needs to be periodically expired. The SessionExpire specifies the
minimum time to keep track of session information.  Defaults to one day.

<p>Some thought should be given to where the databases, error logs,
and session files should be located, especially on an ISP that
might have multiple users sharing a MiniVend server.  In
particular, you might put all of the session files and logs
in a directory that is not writable by the user -- if the
directory or file is corrupted the server may go down.
<p>To test the format of user catalog configuration files before
restarting the server, you can do (from VendRoot):
<p>
<XMP>
    perl -w minivend.pl -test

</XMP>
<p>That will check all configuration files for syntax errors, which
might otherwise prevent a catalog from coming up.  Once a catalog
configures properly, user reconfiguration will not crash it, just
cause an error. But it must come up when the server is started.
<p>
<H2> 
<A NAME="minivend_starting_0">
Starting, Stopping, and Re-starting the Servers</A>

The following commands assume that you made /home/minivend

<p>To start the server:
<p>
<XMP>
    /home/minivend/bin/start

</XMP>
<p>Assuming the server starts correctly, you will see the names of
catalogs as they are configured, along with a message stating
the process ID it is running under.
<p>To re-start the server:
<p>
<XMP>
    /home/minivend/bin/restart

</XMP>
<p>This is typically done to force MiniVend to re-read its configuration.
You will see a message stating that a TERM signal has been sent to the
process ID the servers are running under -- that information is also
sent to /home/minivend/error.log.  Check the error.log file for
confirmation that the server has restarted properly.
<p>To stop the server:
<p>
<XMP>
    /home/minivend/bin/stop

</XMP>
<p>You will see a message stating that a TERM signal has been sent to
the process ID the server is running under -- that information is also sent
to /home/minivend/error.log.  
<p>Because processes waiting for selection on some operating systems block

UNIX and INET modes</A>

As of MiniVend 2.03, either UNIX-domain (the default) or INET-domain
sockets can be used for communication. INET domain sockets are useful
when more than one server, connected via a local-area network (LAN),
is used for accessing a MiniVend server.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE:</STRONG> When sending sensitive information like credit card
numbers over a network, always ensure that the data is secured by a firewall,
or that the MiniVend server runs on the same machine as any SSL-based
server used for encryption.
<p>To make the INET server the default, run the following commands
(again assuming /home/minivend is your MiniVend root directory):
<p>
<XMP>
    cd /home/minivend   # Change to MiniVend root

Needed Directories</A>
</H2>
The MiniVend program, and its supporting libraries, should all
go into one directory.
<p>User catalog pages, user databases, and user configuration files should
all go into their private directories. Because the catalog pages are
served through the MiniVend cgi-bin program and contain nonstandard
elements, they should not be put into a public WWW directory, nor do
they need to have world-readable file permissions.
<p><STRONG>IMPORTANT NOTE</STRONG>: As of MiniVend 2.0, since catalogs are all run
under one server, permissions are complex and very important.
Please let the MiniVend configuration program do the work!
<p>You will want a public WWW directory for in-line image graphic files.
MiniVend does not serve the images, only the HTML tags calling them. A
useful convention is to place all buttonbars, backgrounds, and icons in
the /images directory, with the catalog items perhaps located in the
/images/catalog directory.  It is up to you, but remember that you must
use an <EM>absolute path</EM> -- relative paths will not do. MiniVend 2.0
supports the 
<A HREF="minivend.html#minivend_imagedir_0">ImageDir</A>
 directive, which places that as the
absolute path in front of all relative IMG and INPUT SRC specifications.

Set this to the number of seconds tlink should wait before announcing
that the MiniVend server is not running.  The default of 45 is probably
a reasonable value.

Compiling VLINK and TLINK</A>
</H2>
Change directories to the <EM>src</EM> directory, then run the GNU
configure script:
<p>
<XMP>
    cd src
    ./configure

</XMP>
<p>You will see some output as the configure script checks your system.
Then compile the programs:
<p>
<XMP>
    cc vlink.c -o vlink
    cc tlink.c -o tlink

</XMP>
<p>On some systems you can make the executable smaller with the strip
program. But don't worry about it if strip is not on your system.
<p>
<XMP>
    strip vlink

</XMP>
<p>If you want MiniVend to run under a different user account than your own,
make that user the owner of vlink. (You probably need to be root to do
this). Do not make vlink owned by root, because making vlink setuid
root is an unnecessary security risk.  It should also <STRONG>not</STRONG> normally
run as the default WWW user (often <STRONG>nobody</STRONG>)).
<p>
<XMP>
    chown vendacct vlink

</XMP>
<p>Make vlink setuid:
<p>
<XMP>
    chmod u+s vlink

</XMP>
<p>Move the vlink executable to your cgi-bin directory:
<p>
<XMP>
    mv vlink /the/cgi-bin/directory

</XMP>
<p>Some systems unset the SUID bit when moving the file -- re-set it
if necessary.
