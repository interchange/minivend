SETTING UP SVEND</A>
</H1>
<STRONG>NOTE:</STRONG> As MiniVend has grown more powerful, catalog load time
has increased.  Using <EM>svend</EM> is no longer recommended, and may
not even be possible on some systems.  Support for it will be
removed at some future date.
<p><EM>svend</EM> is a small C program which is setuid to the user account which
can access the catalog data files. The following defines at the
beginning of svend.c should be set:
<p>
<DL COMPACT>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="svend_cgiuser_0">
CGIUSER</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Set this to the numeric uid (user id) which HTTPD runs cgi-bin
programs under. Typically this will be 'http', 'nobody' or 'guest'.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="svend_perl_0">
PERL</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Set this to the location of the perl (version 5 or higher)
executable.
<p>
<DT><STRONG>

<A NAME="svend_vend_0">
VEND</A>

</STRONG>
<DD>
Set to the location of minivend.pl, typically in the VendRoot
directory.
<p>
</DL>
Compile svend.c with your C compiler:.
    cc svend.c -o svend
<p>On some systems you can make the executable smaller with the strip
program. But don't worry about it if strip is not on your system.
<p>
<XMP>
    strip svend

</XMP>
<p>If you want MiniVend to run under a different user account than your own,
make that user the owner of svend. (You probably need to be root to do
this). Do not make svend owned by root, because making svend setuid
root is an unnecessary security risk.
<p>
<XMP>
    chown vendacct svend

</XMP>
<p>Make svend setuid:
<p>
<XMP>
    chmod u+s svend

</XMP>
<p>Move the svend executable to your cgi-bin directory:
<p>
<XMP>
    mv svend /the/cgi-bin/directory

</XMP>
