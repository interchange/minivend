This document describes MaxiVend 1.3.11, written by Mike Heins.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="DESCRIPTION">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
MaxiVend is a CGI-based user interface for MiniVend, the powerful freeware
shopping cart. It gives a user interface suitable for catalog control and
operation without need for telnet interaction by the user.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="A_bit_about_MiniVend">A bit about MiniVend

</A></H2>
MiniVend allows customers to select items to buy from catalog pages. The
program tracks which products they have selected and the quantity desired.
From the ordering page they may complete the ordering process by entering
their name and address, or return to browsing and select more items. Once
the order process is completed, MiniVend submits the order to the system
via email or an external order entry program.


<P>

Though its name begins with ``Mini'', MiniVend is anything but. It is a
high-end, fully customizable, powerful software system with complete
database functionality. It is suitable for many applications besides
shopping carts, though that is its main bent.


<P>

MiniVend plugs into a system with an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SSL</FONT> (Secure Sockets Layer) server, allowing encrypted
transmission of sensitive customer data. This capability makes the entry of
credit card numbers practical and secure.


<P>

Many different catalogs can be run from the same MiniVend server, allowing an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> to serve many different customers from one or just a few MiniVend server processes. As many as 800 MiniVend catalogs have been run on one machine from the same server process.



<P>

Multiple servers can be forked to serve the same set of catalogs. This
ensures fast response, while only one server runs when there is no catalog
activity.


<P>

MiniVend is powerful, and correspondingly complex. It can easily handle
catalogs of a million items or more, with excellent performance. It has
completely flexible page display, search, and order entry capability. If
you only have a few items to catalog, MiniVend is probably overkill for
your needs. But if you are willing to spend some up-front learning time, it
can support your simple catalog with unlimited room to grow. To get a fast
start with a simple catalog, start with the simple demo and customize from
there.


<P>

You can get more information on MiniVend at its web site:

MaxiVend is not freeware like MiniVend. It is not currently available in end-user form; it is designed to be run by an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ISP</FONT> or other dedicated server.

<H1><A NAME="OVERVIEW_OF_MAXIVEND">OVERVIEW OF MAXIVEND

</A></H1>
MaxiVend is integrated into MiniVend with a series of addon Perl modules, MiniVend pages, and MiniVend user-defined tags. It uses one addon 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> program,
 <EM>mv_upload</EM>, which is only used for uploading new database source or pages and
configuration files.


<P>

It is designed to work in concert with a good 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FTP</FONT> program or a Samba- or NFS-mounted directory where
you will edit pages (and possibly export database source) from your local
machine. MaxiVend provides very little page-editing support at this time.


<P>

The configuration pages are in normal MiniVend page space, but are protected via 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> basic authorization. If you don't wish to set up an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> secure 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CGI</FONT> area, MiniVend's internal 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTTP</FONT> server will automatically prevent login by any except the MiniVend
 <EM>RemoteUser</EM>.


<P>

The interface is presented as three frames in an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>HTML</FONT> browser. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> frames-enabled and JavaScript-enabled browser is required; no Java is used. The three frames are named
 <EM>header</EM>, <EM>navigation</EM>, and <EM>content</EM>.


<P>

The top frame, <EM>header</EM>, is a control/status panel. It controls the server configuration, provides
top-level menu selections, and displays status information.


<P>

The left frame, navigation, selects configuration parameters or database
keys to display and edit. If a configuration setting, directive, or
database key is selected from it output will usually go to the <EM>content</EM>
frame.


<P>

The large frame, <EM>content</EM>, is where editing occurs; occasionally complex menus like database
configuration will be displayed there.


<P>

Configuration directives (the contents of a MiniVend catalog.cfg file) are
edited in a <EM>working configuration</EM>. The working configuration does not take effect until the catalog is <EM>reconfigured</EM>, which can be done in the header frame by clicking the <A HREF="#item_Reconfigure">Reconfigure</A> link. Reconfiguration will normally take effect within seconds.


<P>

The working configuration then becomes the <EM>running configuration</EM>.


<P>

The previous running configuration is saved (if there were any changes
made), and if a mistake is made, you may <A HREF="#item_Unconfigure">Unconfigure</A>, which will send you back to the previous configuration (known as the <EM>saved
configuration</EM>.


<P>

Database editing is done by first selecting a <EM>table</EM>, which is a normal MiniVend database table.


<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>IMPORTANT</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTE:</FONT> All edits and changes are made on the actual database; the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> source file does not change unless you export it.



<P>

Once a table is selected (it will default to <CODE>products</CODE>), then you can edit entries (or keys) in the database with several
different selection and view options.


<P>

Keys can be inserted, updated, or deleted from any MiniVend table including 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> databases.



<P>


<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> ``spreadsheet'' mode is usable for smaller
databases; for larger ones (greater than 1 megabyte) it is disabled except
for a key search mode which can select only certain keys from a large
database table.


<P>

You can always input a key name (product code) directly to edit the
complete contents of the entry. 


<P>

You can upload new 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> database source from the <EM>configure/export/upload</EM>
menu available for each table; as with configuration files, these database
source files are saved as a working/running/saved, and may be rotated in
and out.


<P>

<H1><A NAME="THE_HEADER_or_CONTROL_STATUS_PAN">THE HEADER or CONTROL/STATUS PANEL

</A></H1>
The header panel displays the status of the working, running, and saved
MiniVend configurations; it provides links to reconfigure and unconfigure
the catalog; has a link for displaying the contents of the catalog error
log; and selects Configuration or Database functions.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Configuration_Menu">Configuration Menu

</A></H2>
This link causes the <EM>navigation</EM> panel to display MiniVend directives for configuration. They appear in a
series of grouped functions; you can switch to alphabetical display in
navigation.

The top portion of the two-sectioned area has links for:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Reconfigure">Reconfigure

</A></STRONG><DD>
Causes the MiniVend server to reread the configuration from the working
catalog configuration file (<CODE>catalog.cfg+</CODE>) if present, and the running configuration (catalog.cfg) if it is not.


<P>

You may wonder why you would want to use this if no working configuration
is present. The answer is that updates to the special <EM>variable</EM>, <EM>database</EM>, and <EM>locale</EM> database tables will not take effect until the catalog is reconfigured. 


<P>

This link should be displayed in green if you have a color monitor.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_view">view

</A></STRONG><DD>
Displays the contents of the working configuration (catalog.cfg+) file if
it is present.


<P>

This link should be displayed in cyan/light blue if you have a color
monitor.


<P>

</DL>
Below the top area, a small display section displays the serial number of
the working configuration with the date it was originally created.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Running_Configuration">Running Configuration

</A></H2>
In the upper area, the time the catalog was last reconfigured (or the
MiniVend server restarted) is displayed at the top of this section. It also
has a <A HREF="#item_view">view</A> link to view the current <CODE>catalog.cfg</CODE>, or running configuration, file.


<P>

The lower portion displays the serial of the file along with the time it
was originally created. 


<P>

<H2><A NAME="Saved_Configuration">Saved Configuration

</A></H2>
The top portion of the two-sectioned area has links for:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Unconfigure">Unconfigure

</A></STRONG><DD>
Causes the MiniVend server to rotate back the old saved configuration in (<CODE>catalog.cfg-</CODE>) case there are problems with testing of a new running configuration.


<P>

If there is no saved configuration, then unconfiguration will not be
performed.


<P>

This link should be displayed in red if you have a color monitor.


<P>

<DT><STRONG>view

</A></STRONG><DD>
Displays the contents of the saved configuration (<CODE>catalog.cfg-</CODE>) file if it is present.


<P>

This link should be displayed in cyan/light blue if you have a color

Below the top area, a small display section displays the serial number of
the saved configuration with the date it was originally created.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="More_about_reconfiguration_uncon">More about reconfiguration/unconfiguration

</A></H2>
The <EM>running configuration</EM> is always contained in the file <CODE>catalog.cfg</CODE>
file in the base catalog directory. Saved configuration files have a minus
sign (<CODE>-</CODE>) appended, and working configuration files have a plus (<CODE>+</CODE>) sign appended.


<P>

This goes a bit further; an infinite number of saved and working
configuration files may be present. If you create a series of working
configurations, then the saved ones will have additional minus signs
appended. So you will see directory listings like:


<P>

<PRE>        catalog.cfg
        catalog.cfg-
        catalog.cfg--
        catalog.cfg---
        catalog.cfg----
</PRE>

<P>

If you did two unconfigure operations in succession, then the same listing
would be:


<P>

<PRE>        catalog.cfg++
        catalog.cfg+
        catalog.cfg
        catalog.cfg-

<H1><A NAME="EDITING_THE_CONFIGURATION">EDITING THE CONFIGURATION

</A></H1>
When you select <STRONG>Configuration Menu</STRONG> from the header frame, a list of MiniVend configuration settings is
displayed in the <EM>navigation</EM> frame. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> few of these lead to special configuration pages;
most go to a single display of a directive to edit.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Grouped_display">Grouped display

When first displayed, the directives are displayed within function groups.
The groups are:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Alphabetical">Alphabetical

Displays all directly editable directives in alphabetical order. The
special Variable, Database, UserTag, and Locale links are not present.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Localization">Localization

</A></STRONG><DD>
These are the most commonly manipulated settings, ones that will need to be
changed for any catalog. They include the email address orders will be
mailed to, URLs to call the catalog, variable settings, and
internationalization parameters.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Database">Database Setup

</A></STRONG><DD>
The first link, <STRONG>Database</STRONG>, leads to a special editing panel for database setup. This is equivalent
to the MiniVend <A HREF="#item_Database">Database</A> directive, but the configuration is maintained in a special database table
called, appropriately enough, <EM>database</EM>. You can set the source file name, import type, continuation and import parameters, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBI</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DSN,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>SQL</FONT> field types, and other information there.



<P>

The remaining links control other database configuration parameters like
NoImport, ProductFiles, etc. Many users will never want to use these.

<P>

Maxivend allows editing, uploading, and exporting of any MiniVend database
table, with a variety of views and options available. Any of the operations
will operate on any attached Minivend database table except for session
databases.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Accessing_Database_Edit">Accessing Database Edit

</A></H2>
In the header frame there is a link to <STRONG>Edit Databases</STRONG>. Follow this link which will provide a panel in the <EM>navigation</EM> frame. 


<P>

Some of the configuration operations -- <EM>Locale</EM>, <EM>Variable</EM>, <EM>Database</EM>,
<EM>ActionMap</EM>, and <EM>SpecialPage</EM> -- are actually views into database edit.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Edit_control_panel">Edit control panel

The edit control panel is the means for selecting keys (items) to edit, and
provides several links to other menus.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="Select_new_table">Select new table

</A></H2>
It shows the currently selected table, by default <CODE>products</CODE>. When you pull down the select box on this control you will be shown all
editable databases. (There are a few that are hidden by default; they can
be unhidden in <EM>MaxiVend</EM>
control under the <A HREF="#item_Miscellaneous">Miscellaneous</A> configuration menu.)

Unless you have a very large database, you will be given several options
for selecting items (keys) to edit. There are:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_SELECT">SELECT box

</A></STRONG><DD>
You can display all of the keys in a table in a select box. By default, it
is a normal dropdown; but you can disable it to speed up access, and you
can select different-sized windows to show multiple keys on the list. When
you select a key and press the nearby <STRONG>Edit</STRONG> button, that single record will be displayed in the large <EM>content</EM> frame and be ready for edit.


<P>

If your database is larger than 100,000 bytes in size, you will not be
given this option.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_TEXT">TEXT box (or enter key:)

</A></STRONG><DD>
You can input a key name directly, and when you press enter (or click the
nearby edit button) then that single record will be displayed in the large <EM>content</EM> frame and be ready for edit.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Spreadsheet">Spreadsheet

</A></STRONG><DD>
If you check the spreadsheet box and press the <CODE>Edit</CODE> button, then a spreadsheet-like view will be displayed in the large <EM>content</EM> frame.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Key">Key search

</A></STRONG><DD>
There is a small text box in a shaded area. This will search for text in the database

and you wish to select a subset of columns to view in edit or spreadsheet
mode.


<P>

To use this feature, check the boxes corresponding to the names of fields
you wish to edit/view, and click the <CODE>Limit</CODE> button. To reset to the default of all fields displayed, click the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ALL</FONT> button.

<H1><A NAME="CONFIGURING_EXPORTING_AND_UPLO">CONFIGURING, EXPORTING, AND UPLOADING DATABASE TABLES

</A></H1>
MiniVend stores data in any number of formats. By default, it uses a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>GDBM</FONT> or DB_File DBM-based format (if available). It can also use any of many SQL-based databases (Oracle, Informix, MySQL, Sybase, 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MS-SQL,</FONT> and mSQL are just a few examples). Or if none of the above are available, it will store a database in memory; that is pretty volatile, for the moment you stop the MiniVend server it will lose any updates you have made to a database table.



<P>

To load these databases, MiniVend can automatically import from any of 6 different 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> file formats:



<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_TAB">TAB

</A></STRONG><DD>
Typical header record and first record of a table's 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> source:


<P>

<PRE>  code     description   image     price
  00-0011  Mona Lisa print   mona.jpg   100.00
</PRE>

<P>

This is MiniVend's preferred and default format. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>TAB</FONT> delimits fields, newline delimits records.


<P>

The field names are always on the first line of the file. It is recommended
you use all lower case or all upper case to prevent capitalization errors;
MiniVend is case sensitive.


<P>

MiniVend prefers this format because it makes it easy to search 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> files and return their contents. If you keep your files in some other format like 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CSV,</FONT> you might consider exporting an 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> version just for searching.



<P>

No quotes are necessary (nor desirable) around fields; if you produce files with Microsoft's Excel, which has a longstanding bug whereby they surround TAB-delimited fields with quotes when they contain a quote (or comma), then use MiniVend's 
<FONT SIZE=-1>EXCEL</FONT> modifier to compensate.



<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_PIPE">PIPE

</A></STRONG><DD>
Besides 
<FONT SIZE=-1>TAB,</FONT> this works best for MiniVend. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>A</FONT> vertical bar (|), or 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PIPE</FONT> symbol, is used to delimit fields while newline delimits records.



<P>

Typical header record and first record of a table's 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> source:


<P>

<PRE>  code|description|image|price
  00-0011|Mona Lisa|print|mona.jpg|100.00
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_CSV">CSV

</A></STRONG><DD>
This is probably the format that allows the most reliable exchange between different database programs. MiniVend imports this format just fine, but will have difficulty searching the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> source file.



<P>

Commas delimit fields, and newline delimits records. If a comma is within a
field it must be surrounded by double quotes; if a double-quote is within a
field it should be paired with another double quote.


<P>

Typical header record and first record of a table's

<FONT SIZE=-1>LINE</FONT> mode, and is set by using that along with the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTES</FONT> modifier. It is similar to Lotus Notes structured text export format.



<P>

The header record contains the field names that will be used, along with an
unnamed field called <EM>notes_field</EM>. The key or code is always the first field named in the header, and is
required in each record.


<P>

Fields are specified by their field name and a <CODE>:</CODE> (colon), followed by the contents of the field. Order is not important, and
not all fields must be present in a record. (Of course the <CODE>key</CODE>
must always be there if you are to access the record.)


<P>

The special <EM>notes_field</EM> begins at the first blank line in a record, and continues until the record
separator.


<P>

Records are delimited by a form feed 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(CONTROL-L)</FONT> on a line by itself. 


<P>

This format allows free-form editing of a database record with a text
editor without a rigid and error-prone format.


<P>

Typical header record and first record of a table's 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> source:


<P>

<PRE>        code
        image
        price
  
        code: 00-0011
        price: 100.00
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>        Here is the contents of the notes_field,
        accessible with [data table notes_field key] or
        [item-data table notes_field], etc. It ends at the
        record separator (^L) below.
        ^L
</PRE>

<P>

There are other possible format options for the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTES</FONT> mode; here we describe the default case. See the
MiniVend documentation for more information.


<P>

</DL>
The database configuration itself is contained in a database table named <EM>database</EM>. It is accessed by following the &lt;B&gt;Database&lt;/B&gt; link on the
configuration menu page (grouped by function).


<P>

Each database has a file selection attribute, a format 
<FONT SIZE=-1>(TAB,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CSV,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>PIPE,</FONT> etc.) and several other parameters like 
<FONT SIZE=-1>EXCEL,</FONT> 
<FONT SIZE=-1>CONTINUE,</FONT> and 
<FONT SIZE=-1>MEMORY.</FONT> See the MiniVend documentation for their use.



<P>

The <STRONG>Configure/export/upload</STRONG> menu can be reached by following a link in the database edit selector;
remember that is in the <EM>navigation</EM>
(left) frame. When that link is followed a menu will be displayed in the
large <EM>content</EM> frame.

<H2><A NAME="Export">Export

</A></H2>
The <STRONG>Export</STRONG> function allows you to export a MiniVend table to any of its supported
formats, and to any file. This is necessary if you wish to save a text copy
of what is in the database.


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Export">Export as type

</A></STRONG><DD>
Selects any of the standard MiniVend types for export. 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTES</FONT> format will not be usable unless the table is already specified as 
<FONT SIZE=-1>NOTES</FONT> format.



<P>

<DT><STRONG>Export to file

</A></STRONG><DD>
The name of a file to export to. The <CODE>minivend</CODE> user 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ID</FONT> must have permission to write it (or the directory
it will be created in). If you don't specify an absolute path, the file
will be in the <CODE>products</CODE> directory.


<P>

</DL>
If you don't enter a file name or format, the database table will be exported to the default 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> source file; i.e.
 <CODE>products</CODE> would be exported to <CODE>products.txt</CODE> in the <CODE>products</CODE> directory.

<H2><A NAME="Upload_new_database_text_source_">Upload new database text source file

</A></H2>
When you update your product line with new products, or just want to make
some changes to existing products, you will often want to upload a new
database.


<P>

You can 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FTP</FONT> up your new database, but that can cause a couple
of problems:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Temporarily">Temporarily corrupted data

</A></STRONG><DD>
While you are uploading the new database, someone may access the site. If you are writing the 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> source file then MiniVend will attempt to build a new 
<FONT SIZE=-1>DBM</FONT> database -- because 
<FONT SIZE=-1>FTP</FONT> uploads don't lock a file. (This problem can also be prevented by setting 
<FONT SIZE=-1>IMPORT_ONCE.)</FONT>



<P>

Searches on the transitional 
<FONT SIZE=-1>ASCII</FONT> file will also produce incorrect results. And if
you lose your connection in the middle of the upload, the problem could
persist for quite some time.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_No">No backup copy saved

</A></STRONG><DD>
Unless you do a 
<FONT SIZE=-1>RENAME</FONT> or copy to a backup file, the new database will
overwrite the old.


<P>

</DL>
The solution is to use the <STRONG>Upload new database text source file</STRONG> option to upload a file. The upload is done to a temporary file, and then
when you select the <STRONG>Restore or use new database text source file</STRONG> option the new one will be put in place. If you find that the database is
incorrect, you can return to your old one at the click of a button.
