   Interchange is a full-featured electronic catalog system (commonly known
   as a shopping cart) with online ordering capability. It is a high-end
   database access and retrieval system with SQL support via the Perl DBI.

   A full list of its features is available at:

        http://www.minivend.com/
 
IMPORTANT NOTE:  Interchange 4.5.x requires, repeat REQUIRES, Perl 5.005 or Perl 5.6.

The information you need is in the following files:

    README     Copyright info, roadmap to installation
               and pointers to support system
    
    Copying    Your Interchange license -- please read.

               version family.

Major files/directories in the distribution:

    Makefile.PL The installation scripts

    dist/       The distribution files, exclusive of executable
                files and modules. Includes:

                minivend.cfg.dist   Distribution minivend.cfg
                basic/              The basic MV catalog demo application.
                simple/             The not so aptly named "simple" demo
                                    application.
                src/                C and Perl code for CGI links

    extra/      Some not-always-needed Perl libraries.

    lib/        The library modules needed to run Interchange.

                directory.

UNIX INSTALLATION
------------------
Here is the short version:

    gzip -dc minivend-4.xx.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd minivend-4*
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test && make install

-- WHEN IN DOUBT, RE-START THE SERVER.  It won't take but a few
   seconds, and changes in configurable options don't take effect
   until it is done. You may even change a page and not see the
   effect until the server is restarted.

WINDOWS INSTALLATION
--------------------
Not yet. When is not yet determined, but it will not be soon.
If you are very experienced, you might try installing the ZIP
file with "perl Makefile.PL". But *at least* the following problems will
be present:

    1. You need to put "SessionType  DB_File" in catalog.cfg.
    2. Minimate will not work (unless you can build Safe::Hole).
    3. You probably need to use Apache since we no longer support
       cygwin.dll and tlink.exe. If you can get tlink.pl running
       on other web servers, patches are welcome.

Do not use it in a production system.

Interchange 4 has been tested on Solaris 2, Linux, FreeBSD, and Digital
UNIX/Tru64. Its predecessor Minivend 3 also reportedly runs on SCO, AIX,
and other Unix ports.  It should work on any UNIX or Win32 OS with Perl
5.005 or higher.

IMPORTANT NOTE FOR BSD USERS: Interchange has been known to segfault when
reading sockets on Perl. This occurs more frequently on a busy system.
The workaround is to set in minivend.cfg:

    MaxServers   0
    Housekeeping 1

Windows does not support fork(), so the server runs in the foreground. There
are other differences; the canonical installation is UNIX.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

                         D E M O

There are two demo applications included; one is not so aptly named "simple",
the other is "basic". For the best instructional experience, start
with "basic" and then try "simple".

To install the demo, go to the directory where you installed 
Interchange (default is "mvend" in your home directory or /usr/local/minivend
for root installations) and run:

    bin/makecat basic

     or 

    bin/makecat simple

Follow the prompts and after restarting the Interchange server you
should be able to access the demo catalog.

The documentation is in several man pages and HTML files in the doc/
subdirectory of the main Interchange directory.

There is an extended documentation package available
at www.minivend.com.

                    K N O W N   P R O B L E M S

BSDI, FreeBSD, Net BSD:
    You will need to make sure the following are in effect
    in minivend.cfg:

        MaxServers 0
        Housekeeping 1

    Expect lots of crashes if you don't do this.

Apache with SUEXEC:
    VLINK/UNIX socket mode will not work well unless you do the
    install as a normal user. If you are going to support multiple
    users, you must use TLINK/INET mode.

Windows:
    Interchange will not work properly with Windows. No strategy
	has been yet developed for providing reliable operation on Windows.
