You can install Interchange as root for a multi-user system-wide setup, or
as an unprivileged user who will be the only one modifying Interchange files.

Here is the quick installation summary:

gzip -dc interchange-4.9.?.tar.gz | tar xvf -
cd interchange-4.9.?
./configure

Then you will need to make your first Interchange catalog, as described in
the next section.

There is a demo catalog skeleton included called 'foundation'.

To build your own catalog from the demo, go to the directory where you
installed Interchange (default is "interchange" in your home directory,
/usr/local/interchange for root installations, or /usr/lib/interchange
for RPM installations) and run:

bin/makecat

Follow the prompts and after restarting the Interchange server you
should be able to access the demo catalog.

Please note that some functionality (notably the reporting features)
may not be available if you are not using an SQL database such as
MySQL or PostgreSQL.

Visit http://demo.interchange.redhat.com/ to see a live demo on our servers.

The included documentation is in POD and man(1) formats. The developer web
site is located at:

It offers user-annotated documentation, the documentation in other formats,
and a user-contributed code library.

Interchange is regularly tested on Linux, FreeBSD, and Solaris. It
has also been used on OpenBSD, Digital UNIX/Tru64, SCO, AIX, and other
Unix variants. It should work on any Unix with Perl 5.005 or higher and
the necessary Perl modules.
