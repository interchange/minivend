MiniVend 3.00 is greatly changed from MiniVend 2.03, though catalogs
should be almost completely compatible. The exceptions are one or two
pricing and shipping database changes.  In both cases, there is available
backward compatibility. 

Changes include:

    * Installation has been changed to fit the Perl model
      of 'perl Makefile.PL; make; make test; make install'.
      You can also just type './configure' to perform this
      in one step.

      Perl 5.004 allows retrieval and installation of MiniVend
      with 'perl -MCPAN -e 'install Vend::Cart' at the 
      command line.

    * Catalog builder program improved to read Apache/NCSA-style
      configuration files and supply some intelligent defaults.
      Command-line editing and history are supported when the
      Term::ReadLine package is available.

    * Optional modules automatically fetched with CPAN module
      if available.

    * A powerful static page building capability is in place.
      This allows completely automated generation of static HTML
      pages based on MiniVend databases.  Use it to build static
      category lists and product pages that will load quickly without
      the necessity of MiniVend parsing them.
    
    * Dynamic page parsing speed is increased by about 30% when
      using the standard syntax.

    * Multiple product databases allow the breakout of product lines,
      new-used product separation, multi-vendor order routing, and
      more.  The database an item is ordered from is kept with the
      item in the shopping cart, so items ordered with the same part
      number from different databases will not overwrite each other.

    * Database tables are now writable.  Atomic incrementation is
      supported, which means that reliable inventory counts can be
      kept.  Form-based database updates are expanded to encompass
      all databases, not just mSQL.

    * Transactions can be logged to an arbitrary file in an arbitrary
      format with [tag log file]data[/tag].

    * Databases can be exported to an ASCII file with the [tag export ...]
      [/tag] construct.

    * Shipping is much improved, with built-in subroutine calls, 
      error messages for out of bounds conditions, drop-in UPS zone
      files, configurable handling charges, UPS cost rounding, geographic
      qualification, and more regular syntax.

    * Item attribute selection greatly improved, with automated building
      of the item attribute selection.  Item attributes can easily be 
      specified at the time of order.

    * Item attributes can cause price adjustments on either an
      item basis or attribute basis.

    * Uses Data::Dumper's C-based uneval code when available,
      improving session storage speed.

    * Database tables are only actually opened when referenced,
      improving speed greatly on systems that have a large number
      of tables in the database.

    * Experimental DBI/DBD example interface provided, which
      will allow attachment of supported SQL databases like Solid,
      Oracle, or Sybase. THIS IS EARLY ALPHA SOFTWARE. Use only on
      an experimental basis, never with live data.

    * Search engine has improved coordinated matching, with full
      field-independent case-sensitivity, substring matching, and
      negation.

    * Search speed greatly improved when doing complex
      field-coordinated searches.

    * The FullUrl directive allows different virtual hosts to have
      link programs with the same name, i.e. all named /cgi-bin/shop.

    * A new (and still experimental) page syntax allows more regular
      parsing of tags, removing some of the interpolation-order anomalies
      inherent in the old-style tags. It can be invoked on individual
      pages with the [new] tag.

    * Search caching is much improved, and searches can be pre-built
      when using the static page build capability.

    * Pages can be cached, which especially improves performance of
      large parsed pages. Static build is preferred to cache, but
      with large databases it is not practical to build every item
      in advance.

    * Supports Perl 5.004 transparently, making runtime changes to
      affected modules.

    * Better security with the NoAbsolute, AdminPage, .access, and
      AdminDatabase tags.

    * Improved handling of cookies, with savable sessions and dynamic
      expire times.

    * Mailed orders may have MIME attachments. Though the author
      loathes routinely-used MIME, it has value as a way to attach
      an encrypted credit card number for easy processing by an
      order entry workstation.

    * Search sorting bugs fixed.

    * New $Safe{'cgi'}->{form_value} access in embedded Perl allows
      complex conditional search or order routines to be more
      intelligent with regard to user input.

    * New FormIgnore directive allows certain variables to be
      expunged from the user session.

    * Discounted prices can be displayed directly
      with [discount-price].

    * Cookies can be configured for expiration times and multiple
      servers in a domain.

    * Runs with taint checking enabled, even when using
      most embedded Perl code.

    * Many other minor bug fixes, improvements, and changes.

We IMPLORE you to read all of the verbiage below.  We know
how most of us are, so we put the install procedure up here,
but if you have problems please read all of this file, PLUS the
MiniVend documentation in doc/minivend.html.  Also, please check
out the official MiniVend FAQ at http://www.minivend.com/faq/
before you call for help.  And send your system, Perl, and
Minivend information, VERSIONS AND ALL!

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you don't give evidence of having read and
                heeded the above heartfelt plea, your email
                may well be ignored.  Caveat Emptor.

Here is the short version:

    gzip -dc minivend-3.00.tar.gz | tar xvf -
    cd minivend-3.00
    perl Makefile.PL
    make
    make test
    make install
    (change directory to MiniVend root)
    bin/makecat simple
    bin/start

With comments:

    # Unzip and untar the file -- if you have GNU tar, you can substitute
    # 'tar xzf mvend300.tar.gz'
    gzip -dc minivend-3.00.tar.gz | tar xvf -

    # Change directory to the one that was created 
    #
    cd minivend-3.00

    # If you have trouble with picking up the wrong Perl version,
    # try  '/dir/where/perl/is/perl Makefile.PL
    #
    # If you aren't already the user ID of the user who will run the
    # minivend server, you might want to 'su' to that user before
    # running this step.
    #
    # This step will set the MiniVend directory and Perl location,
    # and build the Makefile.
    #
    # If you are upgrading from a previous version, put the 
    # former MiniVend root directory in when prompted for
    # VendRoot.
    #
    perl Makefile.PL

    # Make the library modules and docs
    make

    # Run a rudimentary test to ensure the server and sockets
    # run on your system
    make test

    # Install the files and compile the link programs
    #
    make install

    ####

       At this point, you can follow the instructions that
       the configure program generates.  If you installed
       MiniVend in another directory besides the current one,
       you will have to change directories to that directory
       before continuing.

    ####

    # Become superuser if you are an ISP or other organization that
    # will be running multiple catalogs. If you don't have root access,
    # don't worry about it.
    #

    # Make the demo catalogs -- either one or both. On the first
    # one, you will be prompted for some initial parameters, then
    # asked to re-run.  This is OK.
    #
    bin/makecat sample

    # Make the other catalog. The extension .cat will be
    # put on the catalog configuration file that is created.
    #
    # If you want to make it with a different name, just use:
    #
    #      bin/makecat yourname
    #
    bin/makecat simple

    # Start the MiniVend server
    #
    bin/start

That should be it.  If you have problems, please do what is asked above,
and pretty please reference the web site. And

    -- WHEN IN DOUBT, RE-START THE SERVER.  It won't take but a few
       seconds, and changes in configurable options don't take effect
       until it is done. You may even change a page and not see the
       effect until the server is restarted.

-------------------------------------------------------------

                     D O C U M E N T A T I O N

The documentation is in 3 files in the doc/ subdirectory of
the main MiniVend directory:

           toc.html       Table of contents
           minivend.html  Main documentation file
           tags.html      Complete MiniVend tag reference

These files will be copied to the same HTML directory as
the sample and simple demo gateway files -- they would normally
be referenced as:

           http:/www.yourserver.com/sample/toc.html

                 U P G R A D I N G   F R O M  2 . 0 3

There are a few "gotchas" for 2.0x upgrades:

    * If you have not changed the PriceBreaks directive from
      the demo (you should disable it unless you are actually
      using quantity pricing) you will get a message in the
      error log that "no pricing database is defined". If you
      are using quantity pricing, you will have to set it up
      as a database with at least the fields "sku" and "price"
      by placing those words on the first line, separated by
      a TAB -- and your pricing must be separated from the 
      part number by a TAB as well.

    * The CheckoutFrame, OrderFrame, SearchFrame, and any
      other frame settings are now empty by default. If you
      use frames, you must explicitly define those directives.

    * Perl 5.002 will not work with MiniVend 3.0, and you
      must update.

    * The Cookies directive is now enabled by default.

    * If you have produced a custom catalog template for use
      by the makecat program, you cannot place two directives
      directly after one another.  An example is the 
      VendURL definition of '__MVC_SERVERNAME__MVC_CGIURL'.
      That now must be '__MVC_SERVERNAME____MVC_CGIURL__' 
      which places underscores around the entire name of the
      substitution target.

    * If you are still using the old-style report with $variable
      substitution, you must define the NewReport directive to 'No'.

    * If you use the 'f' formula shipping type in shipping.asc, you
      must either replace the 'x' that was used for the substitution
      of the total to @@TOTAL@@, or you must set the OldShipping 
      to Yes.  The change to the shipping.asc file is recommended,
      as without it you will not be able to use the new shipping
      features of MiniVend.

IRIX, Solaris, Digital UNIX:
           The server may not terminate immediately,
           as the select() call blocks signals. It
           will stop at the next request, or at the
           end of the occasional housekeeping
           cycle, set by the directive HouseKeeping in
           minivend.cfg.  If you want it to stop more
           quickly than the default (up to) 60 seconds,
           either make a page request or set HouseKeeping
           to a lower number.

IRIX:      The UNIX-domain socket version may not work on
           some operating system versions -- patch 596
           is recommended.

BSDI, FreeBSD:
           The BSDI library code is not safely re-entrant
           when used in combination with signals, so no
           signals are sent during server usage.  This is
           transparent to the user.

           MiniVend will not as of this writing work with
           BSDI 3.0 in UNIX mode, so you must use the INET
           mode and the tlink program.

           If the kernel parameter CHILD_MAX is not configured
           above the default of 40, expect problems. Same with
           SO_MAXCONN and some other kernel parameters. 

Solaris:   You must use the File::Lock module -- flock()
           emulation in Perl 5.003 does not work properly, and fcntl()
           locking must be used.  This version of MiniVend includes
           File::Lock, and attempts to install it.

           If you have Perl 5.004, you may be able to
           disregard File::Lock -- MiniVend will try if
           appropriate.

           GCC compilation problems should disappear in this
           release.

   MiniVend is a full-featured electronic catalog system (commonly known
   as a shopping cart) with online ordering capability. It is designed to
   provide an interface complete with SSL security and full database
   support.
   
   MiniVend is freely-redistributable under the GNU General Public
   License -- you can download it via FTP.

   IMPORTANT NOTE:  MiniVend requires Perl 5.003 or higher and GDBM
   or DB_File databases. The program is no longer compatible with 
   NDBM or Perl 5.001.  It *may* work with Perl 5.002, but it is
   no longer supported.

    MiniVend 3.00 Features

       * Users maintain a "shopping cart" for ordered items
       * Multiple independent or shared catalogs allow one server
         to run many store fronts or a "mall"
       * SSL support means secure and practical credit card ordering
       * PGP support for secure off-site mailing of orders
       * Catalogs can be of almost unlimited size with excellent
         performance
       * Multi-server mode for very high capacity on systems with
         sufficient memory
       * Cookie support allows browsers to leave catalog and come
         back without losing session state
       * Complete addressable database support with virtually
         unlimited rows and columns
       * mSQL support includes form-based inserts and updates
       * Many, many, other features

    Powerful search capability

       * Fast binary search
       * One-click scan and search -- build a whole search in a single HREF
       * Complete Glimpse interface
       * Range searching, numeric and alphanumeric
       * Search sorting with reverse, numeric and case-insensitive options
       * Independent field search selection and return
       * Search any file, build results from any database

    Complete control of appearance

       * Full frames support
       * Catalog pages automatically selected -- either built
         "on the fly" from the database or pre-made for popular items
       * The on-the-fly page is selectable from the database
       * Embedded Perl and conditional HTML allow complex and
         flexible catalog pages to be completely built from
         the database

    Flexible Ordering Process

        * Multi-level order screens with configurable field
          verification
        * Multiple shopping carts per catalog, allows both buy
          and sell operations
        * Shipping calculation, mixed modes, with UPS table lookup
        * Sales tax calculation, with fully independent non-taxable
          item and taxed shipping
        * PGP encryption of credit card information or
          the entire emailed order
        * Fully-configurable discounts with coupons or
          across-the-board discounts
        * Fully-configurable quantity pricing
        * Fully-configurable item price adjustments
        * Sophisticated back end order entry capability
        * Full client-side imagemap support, including frame targets and form
          submits
        * Fully configurable order reports

    Easy Administration

        * Automated installation and configuration
        * Runs under Perl 5 and almost any UNIX
        * Designed to be secure
        * Built-in online help capability
        * Off line database builds
        * Static page build option for high performance
        * Works well with all browsers

    Andrew Wilcox wrote Vend, the copylefted shopping cart software.
    MiniVend is based on Vend V0.2, but enhanced considerably,
    adding support for frames, powerful searching, remote
    administration, superfast server mode, conditional HTML,
    user-customizable help and displays, and much more. This version
    of MiniVend includes an automatic configuration and installation
    utility, and continues to be free under the GNU copyleft.

    To learn more about MiniVend, see the HTML documentation, visit
    the official MiniVend site, or download it.

                         D E M O

There are two demos supplied. The 'sample' demo demonstrates
frames on MiniVend, the 'simple' demo does not use frames.

To install the demos, go to the MiniVend installation directory
and run:

    bin/makecat simple
    bin/makecat sample

Follow the prompts and after restarting the MiniVend server you
should be able to access the new catalogs.

MiniVend has been well-tested on Solaris 2, SunOS, Linux, HP-UX,
and OSF/Alpha.  It should work on any UNIX with Perl 5.003 or
higher.

BSDI and FreeBSD are known to have problems with Perl socket
code, which MiniVend relies heavily upon. You can expect some
reliability problems with those operating systems.

DB_File is the fastest DBM for use with MiniVend -- GDBM is
the easiest to build if you must install it yourself.

For Solaris 2, you may need the File::Lock module, which is
now included with MiniVend (installation is attempted).

Please let the author know if you have successfully run MiniVend
on any additional platforms -- patches would be appreciated.

Setting up a MiniVend catalog can be quite complex, and that
is why the documentation and demos were provided.  They should
be sufficient to get you started. Many hours have been spent
in documenting the features of MiniVend, and thoughtful users
should almost always find their answers there.

Key things that people sometimes don't understand:

    -- The actual pages of the catalog are NOT in HTML document
       space.  They are in the catalog directory of the catalog
       that is in question.

    -- The highly interpolative nature of MiniVend and HTML tags
       means that order is often important.

    -- The first thing to do in setting up a custom MiniVend catalog
       is to define the database.  Everything with MiniVend stems
       from the products database -- many of the custom features
       depend on the shipping, salestax, accessories, pricing,
       and other databases.  Determine your data set first.

    -- The demo pages are there to be played with.  With MiniVend
       3.00, you can't stop the system simply by changing a page.

    -- Many of the configurable features of MiniVend are determined
       by the directives in catalog.cfg (or minivend.cfg in a standalone
       catalog).

    -- WHEN IN DOUBT, RE-CONFIGURE THE CATALOG.  It won't take but a few
       seconds, and changes to many of the configurable options don't
       take effect until it is done.

The author is very interested in learning your problems with
MiniVend, and is interested in clarifying the documentation for
future improvements.  (He isn't much interested in BEING your
documentation, though, unless you pay well and promptly.) Please
