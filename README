MiniVend 2.03 is greatly changed from MiniVend 2.02, though
catalogs should be almost completely compatible, with the
exception of one or two precedence changes in the [if ...]
conditionals.

Changes include:

	* Re-configuring a catalog can now be done on an individual
	  basis.  No more server re-starts for a user to change their
	  configuration.

	* MiniVend no longer requires DBM, though it is still best to use
	  GDBM or DB_File if available. There is a file-based session
	  storage message mechanism, and product databases can
	  be stored in memory.  This is automatically selected if
	  appropriate.

	* Multi-server mechanism changed completely.  Only one
	  server runs when in quiescent state -- it forks additional
	  servers as necessary, up to a limit you decide.

	* Runs on just about any Unix operating system with
	  no changes, providing Perl 5.002 is available.  This
	  includes IRIX, which formerly would not run MiniVend.

	* Perl subroutines can now be defined on three levels, and
	  directly called from MiniVend pages. Two use the Safe.pm module
	  for enforcing security, while an administrator-enabled GlobalSub
	  routine can run external programs for complete control.

	* mSQL support is now considered stable, and the databases
	  can be updated by forms from within MiniVend.

	* The link CGI program may now use TCP-based sockets, which
	  allows the link CGI to be located on a different machine than
	  the MiniVend server.  Be careful of security, though!

	* Perl link programs are provided for systems without a C compiler.
	  (Solaris still needs a C compiler for File::Lock, unless it is
	  already installed on Perl.)

	* Search sorting and list parsing can now be done on a named
	  field basis for all files.

	* Search sorting can be done right on the page from returned
	  fields, and be sorted by field based on form options.

	* Search sorting can be done right on the page from returned
	  fields, and be sorted by field based on form options.

	* Order and search profiles now can be fully evaluated 
	  for conditionals.

	* The [if ...] conditionals are much improved.  Contained
	  HTML can now be deferred until the last interpolation pass
	  with the [post] [/post] tag pair.  Fixed problem with
	  [if salestax ..].

	* New mv_click and mv_check special variables set multiple
	  form parameters with a single form button.

	* Cookies are only sent once if enabled, preventing annoying
	  multiple warnings if the user has them turned on.
	
	* If the user is going through multiple proxy servers (as
	  AOL users do), the session will be stable.
	
	* If REMOTE_USER is present, the IP address will not be
	  used for 

	* Many other minor bug fixes, improvements, and changes.

We IMPLORE you to read all of the verbiage below.  We know
how most of us are, so we put the install procedure up here,
but if you have problems please read all of this file, PLUS the
MiniVend documentation in doc/minivend.html.  Also, please check
out the official MiniVend FAQ at http://www.iac.net/~mikeh/faq/
before you call for help.  And send your system, Perl, and
Minivend information, VERSIONS AND ALL!

IMPORTANT NOTE: If you don't give evidence of having read and
                heeded the above heartfelt plea, your email
                may well be ignored.  Caveat Emptor.

Here is the short version:

    gzip -d mvend203.tar.gz
    tar xf mvend203.tar
    cd mvend203
    ./configure
    su
    bin/makecat sample
    bin/makecat simple
    bin/start

With comments:

    # Unzip and untar the file -- if you have GNU tar, you can combine
    # the first two steps with 'tar xzf mvend203.tar.gz'
    gzip -d mvend203.tar.gz
    tar xf mvend203.tar

    # Change directory to the one that was created -- this is a change
    # from MiniVend 1.0x.
    #
    cd mvend203

    # If you have trouble with picking up the wrong Perl version,
    # try  '/dir/where/perl/is/perl configure.pl /dir/where/perl/is/perl'.
    #
    # If you aren't already the user ID of the user who will run the
    # minivend server, you might want to 'su' to that user before
    # running this step.
    #
    # This step will set the MiniVend directory and Perl location,
    # and build the small dispatch program.
    #
    # If in doubt, the defaults are probably OK.
    #
	# If you are upgrading from a previous version, put the 
	# former MiniVend root directory in when prompted for
	# VendRoot.
	#
    ./configure

	####

	   At this point, you can follow the instructions that
	   the configure program generates.  If you installed
	   MiniVend in another directory besides the current one,
	   you will have to change directories to that directory
	   before continuing.

	####

    # Become superuser if you are an ISP or other organization that
    # will be running multiple catalogs
    #
    su

    # Make the demo catalogs -- either one or both. On the first
    # one, you will be prompted for some initial parameters, then
    # asked to re-run.  This is OK.
    #
    bin/makecat sample

    # Make the other catalog. The extension .cat will be
    # put on the catalog configuration file that is created.
    #
    # If you want to make it with a different name, just use:
    #
    #      bin/makecat yourname
    #
    bin/makecat simple

    # Start the MiniVend server
    #
    bin/start

That should be it.  If you have problems, please do what is asked above,
and pretty please reference the web site. And

    -- WHEN IN DOUBT, RE-START THE SERVER.  It won't take but a few
       seconds, and changes in configurable options don't take effect
       until it is done. You may even change a page and not see the
       effect until the server is restarted.

IRIX, Solaris, Digital UNIX:
           The server may not terminate immediately,
           as the select() call blocks signals. It
           will stop at the next request, or at the
           end of the occasional houskeeping
           cycle, set by the directive HouseKeeping in
           minivend.cfg.  If you want it to stop more
           quickly than the default (up to) 60 seconds,
           either make a page request or set HouseKeeping
           to a lower number.

IRIX:      The UNIX-domain socket version may not work on
           some operating system versions -- patch 596
           is recommended.

FreeBSD:   If the kernel parameter CHILD_MAX is not configured
           above the default of 40, expect problems.

Solaris:   You must use the File::Lock module -- flock()
           emulation in Perl does not work properly, and fcntl()
           locking must be used.  This version of MiniVend
           includes File::Lock, and attempts to install it.

           If you are using GCC on Solaris, you may have to
           compile manually and pass -DSVR4 -lsocket on the
           compile command line, particularly if you have not
           disabled the script that is called 'cc' in many
           Sun distributions.  If the vlink compile fails,
           run this series of commands *immediately* after
           running the configure script:

                cd src gcc -DSVR4 -lsocket -o vlink
                vlink.c cd ..

            If vlink compiles without error, you can make
            the catalogs and run normally.

    Andrew Wilcox wrote Vend, the copylefted shopping cart software.
    MiniVend is based on Vend V0.2, but enhanced considerably,
    adding support for frames, powerful searching, remote
    administration, superfast server mode, conditional HTML,
    user-customizable help and displays, and much more. This version
    of MiniVend includes an automatic configuration and installation
    utility, and continues to be free under the GNU copyleft.

    To learn more about MiniVend, see the HTML documentation, visit
    the offical MiniVend site, or download it.

There are two demos supplied. The 'sample' demo demonstrates
frames on MiniVend, the 'simple' demo does not use frames.

To install the demos, go to the MiniVend installation directory
and run:

    bin/makecat simple
    bin/makecat sample

Follow the prompts and after restarting the MiniVend server you
should be able to access the new catalogs.

MiniVend has been well-tested on Solaris 2, SunOS, Linux,
OSF/Alpha, BSDI, and FreeBSD.  It should work on any UNIX
with Perl 5.002 or higher.

DB_File is the fastest DBM for use with MiniVend -- GDBM is
the easiest to build if you must install it yourself.

For Solaris 2, you will need the File::Lock module, which is
now included with MiniVend (installation is attempted).

Please let the author know if you have successfully run MiniVend
on any additional platforms -- patches would be appreciated.

Setting up a MiniVend catalog can be quite complex, and that
is why the documentation and demos were provided.  They should
be sufficient to get you started. Many hours have been spent
in documenting the features of MiniVend, and thoughtful users
should almost always find their answers there.

Key things that people sometimes don't understand:

    -- The actual pages of the catalog are NOT in HTML document
       space.  They are in the catalog directory of the catalog
       that is in question.

    -- The highly interpolative nature of MiniVend and HTML tags
       means that order is often important.

    -- The first thing to do in setting up a custom MiniVend catalog
       is to define the database.  Everything with MiniVend stems
       from the products database -- many of the custom features
       depend on the shipping, salestax, accessories, pricing,
       and other databases.  Determine your data set first.

    -- The demo pages are there to be played with.  With MiniVend
       2.03, you can't stop the system simply by changing a page.

    -- Many of the configurable features of MiniVend are determined
       by the directives in catalog.cfg (or minivend.cfg in a standalone
       catalog).

    -- WHEN IN DOUBT, RE-CONFIGURE THE CATALOG.  It won't take but a few
       seconds, and changes to many of the configurable options don't
       take effect until it is done.

The author is very interested in learning your problems with
MiniVend, and is interested in clarifying the documentation for
future improvements.  (He isn't much interested in BEING your
documentation, though, unless you pay well and promptly.) Please
